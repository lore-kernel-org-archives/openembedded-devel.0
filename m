I've just sent a patch to the yocto@ list to fix this but it's brought
up two things:

1) In openembedded-core/meta/classes/image.bbclass SPLASH is set with
'?='. I'm overriding this with '=' in
meta-raspberrypi/conf/machine/raspberrypi.conf which means it can't be
overridden further in local.conf. Is this worth changing to '??=' in
image.bbclass, '?=' in the machine conf so that it can be overridden
with '=' in local.conf? Is my understanding of the overrides correct
here?

2) If you look at the patch I've basically added the raspberrypi logo
as an extra psplash image and overridden SPLASH in the machine conf to
make this the default for raspberrypi. Is this the intended approach
for customising psplash images? There's a lot of interesting logic in
the psplash recipe and it took me a while to figure out. If I've got
it right it may be worth adding some documentation comments to explain
this method. If I've got it wrong could someone correct me.

Both of these (assignment change and adding documentation) would be
patches to openembedded-core.

Thanks.
