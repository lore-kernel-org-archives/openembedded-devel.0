Because you fix one race condition by introducing another one. If there =
is
another word than broken for it, I'm happy to learn that,

I didn't talk about your work for the kernel, I'm just talking about =
your
patch to fix initially mentioned race condition.

Understood, so your primary tooling becomes slower.

I'm sorry - but I didn't got that. I still don't get that you
don't need that explanation. Even if you understand more and deeper
what's going on when building kernel and tools and 3rd party
modules around that - several people running into that race condition
and you disagree that moving the race keeps the thing broken.

Great! Thanks, Bruce.
