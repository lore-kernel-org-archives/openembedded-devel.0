This is kind of insane to try a fix duplicating a job in a probably =
wrong way
(even a tiny) because of performance issue.

Any 3rd party kernel module depends on do_shared_workdir - so =
do_shared_workdir
must wait for do_compile_kernelmodules - that's it by design (build is =
done
relying on dependencies ordered in a directed, noncyclical graph.

Since compile_kernelmodules is between compile and strip, I vote for

$ git diff
diff --git a/meta/classes/kernel.bbclass b/meta/classes/kernel.bbclass
index 5e8b6cf..49d7561 100644
--- a/meta/classes/kernel.bbclass
+++ b/meta/classes/kernel.bbclass
@@ -253,7 +253,7 @@ kernel_do_install() {
 }
 do_install[prefuncs] +=3D "package_get_auto_pr"

-addtask shared_workdir after do_compile before do_compile_kernelmodules
+addtask shared_workdir after do_compile_kernelmodules before do_strip
 addtask shared_workdir_setscene

 do_shared_workdir_setscene () {

But that's surely kind of smell, whether before do_strip and do_install =
is
preferred. Mandatory is, that do_shared_workdir must not be processed =
before
do_compile_kernelmodules finishes.

There is no way to avoid it, and if those 5 seconds slow down your =
build,
there is probably another thing which should be fixed.

Cheers
