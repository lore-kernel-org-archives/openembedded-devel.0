Qt Embedded as we build it is currently configured to use tslib, as is
SDL. If the alternative (evdev?) is supported they could presumably be
switched over though. I don't know how practical that is however.

The following commit introduced this:

http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/commit/?id=c48a6a605c6d8d38cfbc5df39b3dc310bffc07c1

Otavio can you explain further?

OK, great.

Well, we already have gst-ffmpeg in OE-Core so I can't imagine libav
would be any worse as long as it is similarly protected with
LICENSE_FLAGS.
