I'm not following; meta-yocto is already called meta-yocto ... ? Maybe you 
didn't realise Koen was joking...

That doesn't solve the problem I was talking about, namely that there's little 
distinction between meta-openembedded the repository (that contains a number 
of layers) and meta-oe which is one of those layers. These are two different 
things and the similar naming makes it hard to always know which one people 
are talking about.
