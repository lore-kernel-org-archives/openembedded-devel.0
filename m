The outcome for the short term was to allow community-developed layers on 
openembedded.org (where slugos/nslu should fall into that category, AFAICS) 
and not yet the commercial layers/BSPs from manufacturers (those should be 
directed to Yocto or asked to provide own hosting).

One of the reasons named was infrastructure limitations on openembedded.org as 
of now. There were several possible solutions to hosting limitations discussed 
few weeks ago by the board and involved parties...
