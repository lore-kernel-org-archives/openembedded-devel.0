This seems like a step in the right direction to me.

I do think we should also pursue going a step further, adding the ability
to automatically emit a per-binary-package -dbg package, rather than a
single monolithic recipe-wide one. This would mean that adding dbg-pkgs to
an image is cleaner and doesn't result in installing every sub-package of
the recipe. This change you're proposing would make it easier to extend to
potentially do this, possibly optionally.
