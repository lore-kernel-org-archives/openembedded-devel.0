I really like this idea, I think it will improve situation with:
status updates - people can watch it immediately on IRC, instead=20
  of waiting for minutes
lack of community input - easier for people to comment on issues or add
  to agenda when they see discussion about related topic
community involvement - seeing some AR discussed a month ago is too late
  to volunteer

p3-only looks good to me, I would be happy to help testing this and then
drop p2 from my minimalistic chroot. There are also some external tools
like opkg-utils (IIRC this one is 99% p3 compatible now, I can take care
of remaining).

I like them.

For many recipes I've used meta-shr as "staging" area to test it on more
builders and probably by more people before moving them to meta-oe.

But it's also easy to forget them in "staging" area, when they just
work for me (as I have meta-shr always included) and nobody shows any=20
interest in them.
