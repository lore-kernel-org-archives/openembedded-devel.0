I do find the above useful -- include the kconfig part.

I've never used uclibc with the Yocto Project framework.  I think musl is a lot
more compelling moving forward.

I really would like to keep kconfig support still.  It's definitely useful, but
it's of course not the main workflow.

I wouldn't object to his.

I definitely wouldn't object to this.  I do think keeping the uclibc hooks and
such in oe-core for the time being does make sense.  It would be interesting to
know how often it is still being used... (and I do think musl is a better
replacement for this use-case.)

> 4. Poky-tiny switches to use musl

I think there are two usages here.. one is a small 'glibc' interface where the
API is glibc compatible, but restricted..

And a "don't care about the libc, as long as it works and is small" use case
which was traditionally uclibc, but now can be fulfilled by musl.

I do still think a 'tiny' glibc is useful -- however with musl being a lot more
capable of working then uclibc was, the usefulness may be diminishing.

This certainly makes it worthwhile to consider putting into oe-core proper.
Again, I have no objections to introducing musl.
