pre-release version of gnome 47. There were some issues, mainly in 
tracker. Besides the obligatory newly included build paths, the 
programs were annoyingly renamed from tracker/tracker-miners to 
tinysparql/localsearch. This has caused a merry go round of changes all 
over the place.

I will wait to send the updates to the mailing list until styhead 
release is finalized. At best gtk4, glib-2.0 and libadwaita in oe-core 
should be updated first. That would allow to put in all the updates for 
meta-openembedded in one go.

This includes all the changes I made to oe-core and meta-openembedded. 
I have tested this for x86-64 and aarch64 so far.
