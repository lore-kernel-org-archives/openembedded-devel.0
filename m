I've wondered about:

DL_DIR/server1.org/somepath/somefile.patch

Not necessarily with the right mirror/premirror configuration.

That is a pain but we've basically always assumed no namespace
collision. I'm not saying that is a good thing, just the way it is.

Not creating done files for local urls causes a variety of problems, not
least that you then have to special case local urls in the generic
fetcher code, it also hits performance. I've been trying to get the
fetcher away from a set of special cases...
