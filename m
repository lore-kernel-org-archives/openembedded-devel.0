There is often (I won't say always, but often) something useful you can put in 
the commit message. If it's a recipe upgrade, you could put a pointer to the 
upstream changelog in it, for example. As the person doing the upgrade if your 
prior review of that changelog or other upstream release documentation 
indicated any backwards-compatibility issues or CVEs fixed then those really 
ought to be mentioned as well; if you're feeling especially generous you might 
mention highlights of any new functionality. (I have a proposal that might 
help us automate part of that which I've not yet fully fleshed out, hopefully 
one day soon I will get around to it.)

The issue of empty commit messages is something I've complained about in the 
past, and not just about recipe upgrades. If I - as someone who is relatively 
familiar with OE - have to actually read beyond the shortlog / commit message 
to understand the basics of why a change has been made, then it's likely that 
the commit message wasn't good enough. Unlike other issues, once a commit goes 
in the message is set in stone within the git history, so if you are working 
on a change, *please* take a minute or two to document it adequately in the 
commit message so that others looking back can understand it.

Thanks,
Paul
