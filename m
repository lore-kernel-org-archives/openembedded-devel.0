Another incremental with many fixes for foreign automake and missing
dependencies for m4 macro providers and couple of PNBLACKLISTs.

Complete logs:

3722.log/

mkvtoolnix is review for new version, it builds fine on 2/3 builders I
have access too, I'll investigate before merging it

firefox is probably fixed by
http://patchwork.openembedded.org/patch/75173/
I'll include this work around in my next world builds

monkey issue is in new review and looked at by submitter

lttng-modules issue was reported on ML and it seems that we can expect
upgrade to newer version soon

openal-soft, gst-ffmpeg aren't compatible with libav-9 now used by world
builds.

packagegroup-shr-feed is here just because of firefox

ERROR: 17 issues were found in these recipes: firefox gst-ffmpeg
lttng-modules mkvtoolnix monkey openal-soft packagegroup-shr-feed

So it looks like we're again in better shape, but something is strange
with this new insane_qa check for build dependencies, since it was
introduced in master-next it finds more issues than test-dependencies.sh
did and vice-versa test-dependencies.sh now doesn't report some issues
which IIRC weren't properly fixed yet. So we need to double check why.
