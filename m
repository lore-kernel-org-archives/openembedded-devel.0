I'm not sure, but my gut feeling is you'd be better off trying to bring the 
project up to be based on OE-Core rather than trying to bring such 
functionality back to OE-Classic, particularly since for full functionality it 
requires signature-based tasks that are only supported with current versions 
of bitbake and require support from the metadata. You'd be trading some 
hopefully short-term pain for long-term gain if the project is going to 
continue for a reasonable amount of time.

Cheers,
Paul
