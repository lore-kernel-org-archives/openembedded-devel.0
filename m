The gst-ffmpeg failure is somewhat strange. Both libav and libpostproc
can provide libpostproc but at least in my tests, it builds just fine
regardless of which one(s) I've previously built (both in OE-Core and
with meta-oe added).

So I'm not sure why its happening or therefore how to fix it :/.
