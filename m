(I presume this is in the context of OpenEmbedded.) What you describe is the 
accepted way of doing things - you have a recipe for each version of the piece 
of software you're building and share the common things with a .inc file, using 
${PV} to abstract away the version. Each individual recipe ends up quite small 
with the bulk of the definitions in the inc file.

You could have a recipe which did not specify a version in the recipe filename, 
and set PV manually instead (possibly with a default); then you could set 
PV_pn-bjam = "1.1" in your distro or local configuration to pick the version. 
However I would describe that as unorthodox, and it will not work if you have 
to handle other differences between versions (e.g. renamed/moved files, 
additional configuration options, etc.) I will say however that this is more or 
less how we handle recipes built from a version control system (e.g. git); 
except in that case we set PV to something including SRCREV e.g. 
"1.0+gitr${SRCPV}" and then set SRCREV externally.

The question is will you really need 5 different versions? Or just 2-3?

Cheers,
Paul
