tslib is also requested on devices where kernel driver returns too much
noise, tslib can filter that, evdev needs separate filter like=20
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~metan/evfilter/
but that isn't integrated in OE.

The biggest difference is integrated xinput-calibrator and use of

MySQL and PostgreSQL are not in oe-core so it cannot be replaced with
simple PACKAGECONFIG option in oe-core recipe, but I also prefer to
share such .bbappend somewhere instead of every distribution reinventing
the wheel when trying to enable something as simple as db in qt.
