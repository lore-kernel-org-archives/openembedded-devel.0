My understanding was that Koen was talking about renaming
meta-openembedded repository to meta-yocto, which would be kind of nice,
but too late for that now, it would be very confusing with the other
meta-yocto repository.

What's even worse is that github mirror names the repositories
meta-oe/oe-core so even the small distinction "meta-openembedded" =3D
repo, "meta-oe" =3D layer doesn't work there.
