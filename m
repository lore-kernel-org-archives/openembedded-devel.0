I was afraid to get this answer. ;-)

Unfortunately we do not have the manpower to bring up this old project to oe-core. Our team is working hard on a follow-up project based on oe-core.

I read something about a solution using

  BB_GIT_CLONE_FOR_SRCREV = "1"
  BB_LOCALCOUNT_OVERRIDE = ""

which should be supported by the old oe-classic/bitbake-1.12.0. Could this be a solution for our problem? What drawbacks does it have?
