Surely in the case Ross describes, the "imx5" bit would be encoded into
the package name (i.e. they'd be libgl-imx5) and then PACKAGE_ARCH can
just be used as normal to represent the ISA and/or ABI.  I can't think
of any situation where encoding the GPU type into PACKAGE_ARCH would be
especially useful.
