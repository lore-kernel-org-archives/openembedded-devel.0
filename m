I made a quick test and the failures I spotted from meta-oe likely due
to this patch were:

re2c
libsdl-iomage
claws-plugin-gtkhtml2-viewer
claws-plugin-rssyl
libsdl-tiff
libol
ode
dejagnu
memcached
rp-pppoe
ipsec-tools
mtr
hplip
onig

Its probably not a complete list as I have a lot more failures than your
world builds but it gives some idea of number and its not a massive
list.

Cheers,

Richard
