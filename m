Lets leave this as it is then.

I've had no responses to the second point I made or feedback on my
patch to meta-raspberrypi. I really think it's worth adding a
documentation comment to the psplash recipe to explain the intended
way to customise the splash image as the logic there isn't
straightforward. My approach was to append the image to SPLASH_IMAGES
in a bbappend and then set this as the default via the SPLASH variable
in the machine config file for raspberrypi. I imagine it'd be a
similar approach for setting a distro default. It then ensures that
just including a machine or distro layer with a bbappend to psplash
doesn't force it's image on the user unless they're building for that
machine or distro. Is that the correct approach? If so I'm happy to
submit a patch adding something to this effect as a documentation
comment to the psplash recipe.
