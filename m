I have booted core-image-minimal, for all arches and that have worked =
fine for both systemd and sysvinit and some of non-oe-core graphic =
images booted well too
but here it seems its using core-image-sato wondering what changed there =
=E2=80=A6 can someone try it out and may be see what is it trying to =
launch during boot that is in addition
to core image minimal.=
