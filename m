It's not down again, a number of the sources have not been restored or 
have been moved, still trying to track some of this down.

There should be source mirrors at the yoctoproject.org website as well

We do run a nightly fetch, but I think we have our mirror set so we 
don't see the full fails, it might be a good idea to figure out the 
complete failure set right now with no PREMIRROR or MIRRRORs.
