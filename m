And what about .sigdata files?

I have sort shell script to replace symlinks with real files in prefixed
dirs, would it be worth it integrating to=20
openembedded-core/scripts/sstate-cache-management.sh
which doesn't work with new layout anyway?

In two separate recipes right?

So you would store them in DL_DIR/server1.org/somefile.patch path?=20

That would make oposite scenario where the BIG.tgz is available=20
(or even requested by different recipes) from different location less
efficient.

And not creating .done files for local files fetched from file:// whould
also help for:

foo.bb: SRC_URI =3D "file://somefile.patch"
bar.bb: SRC_URI =3D "http://server2.org/somefile.patch"=20

Which now ignores checksums for samefile.patch downloaded for bar.bb if
foo.bb was built before.

Cheers,
