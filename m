Currently, enabling Link Time Optimization via:

require conf/distro/include/lto.inc
DISTRO_FEATURES_append =3D " lto"

makes the build non-reproducible (as in
https://reproducible-builds.org/).=C2=A0 This patch set fixes some of the
problems, but is not yet a complete solution.

This patch set addresses the following bugs:
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D14481
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D14490

openembedded-core patches
1/4: lto.inc: disable LTO for grub
2/4: gcc: Backport patch to make LTO builds more reproducible
3/4: bitbake.conf: add DEBUG_PREFIX_MAP to TARGET_LDFLAGS

openembedded-devel patches
4/4: net-snmp: fix QA Issue after LDFLAGS change

Patch 3 adds DEBUG_PREFIX_MAP to TARGET_LDFLAGS (it was already in
TARGET_CFLAGS).=C2=A0 This could possibly be done differently, such as by
removing it from TARGET_CFLAGS and adding it to TOOLCHAIN_OPTIONS,
TARGET_CC_ARCH, or TUNE_CCARGS, but I haven't tested those.=C2=A0 Let me =
know
if there is a better/preferred way to do it.

The TARGET_LDFLAGS change broke net-snmp from meta-networking, so I have
included a patch to fix that.=C2=A0 Other packages might have been broken=
 as
well, although I haven't found any others.

With all these patches, there are still many shared libraries in /lib
and /usr/lib that are still not reproducible with LTO enabled because
x86_64-poky-linux-libtool filters out the -f*-prefix-map flags added by
patch 3 when linking shared libraries.=C2=A0 /usr/lib/libbz2.so.1.0.6 fro=
m
the libbz2 package from the bzip2 recipe is a good example.=C2=A0 I do no=
t
have a patch for that problem.=C2=A0 I will leave that to someone else.

So this is what we need to achieve reproducible LTO builds:
*) This patch set
*) A fix for libtool
*) Add LTO to reproducible builds testing if appropriate (e.g.
meta/lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/reproducible.py, CI on Autobuilder)
*) Fixes for individual packages, if needed
*) Once everything works, update the documentation again (I previously
requested a documentation change for this bug, which will eventually
show up at
http://docs.yoctoproject.org/test-manual/reproducible-builds.html).
