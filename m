I've got a machine under development that boots from the 2013.01 recipe
and a bbappend. I don't think it is a problem moving to .03, but I don't
know. I'm not sure how many other BSP's have done the same.

Meanwhile, I understand the desire of others who have work upstreamed in
u-boot they like to use with the next release.

How many u-boot releases are there a year? How do they line up with YP
releases? Should we carry two u-boot versions, similar to what happens
with the kernel?
