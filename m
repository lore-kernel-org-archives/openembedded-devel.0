Sorry to double reply but had a thought on this one thing in particular.

Is there any way to list recipes (or tasks) which weren't executed
because a dependency failed? I know we see this at the start of the
build if dependencies can't be satisfied, I'm thinking tasks with
satisfied dependencies but then those dependencies fail.

Being able to see that chain for each build may help us prioritise. It
would also show whether a failure disappearing was due to the issue
being fixed or the recipe no longer being attempted due to a new
failure somewhere else.

Thanks,
