I looked around for this a bit: As Saul pointed out, in bitbake.conf we hav=
e
FILES_${PN} =3D ... ${libdir}/${BPN}/* ...

This
* drags in all below this directory ( e.g *.la / *.a )
* Forces me to rewrite FILES_${PN} in evince ( e.g just adding
${libdir}/${BPN}/*/backends/*.a to FILES_${PN}-staticdev fixes nothing
). This is something I would like to avoid.

Suggestions?

I guess others but evince are also affected.
