Well, as I just mentioned in my reply to Paul I have produced a document 
describing OE-core here:

 http://www.openembedded.org/index.php/OpenEmbedded-Core

I don't know that it explicitly describes all the repositories but it does 
give some idea of the motivations.

OE-dev provides support for h1940, yes, but I wouldn't expect that to be 
maintained in future. However, read on...

So most of the new development should happen either in OE-core or some layer 
on top. Hopefully I will soon be able to release a layer called "meta-
handheld" that I have been working on which will provide machine support for 
h1940 amongst other handheld devices. If you're using OE-dev now that's OK, if 
you have any patches against OE-dev they will be easy to re-apply to meta-
handheld or whereever is appropriate.

Cheers,
Paul
