Actually the ordering of PACKAGES matters here and since bitbake.conf 
lists the ${PN}-dev and ${PN}-staticdev package before ${PN}, you can 
append the ${libdir}/${BPN}/3/backends/*.a to FILES_${PN}-staticdev and 
it will pull those first before doing the FILES_${PN}. does that make 
sense?  You don't have to re-write FILES_${PN}.
