I didn't say that you supported that, just that you was aware and didn't
complain about it being such a bad idea.

The split was there before too, because more recipes were using some
number of spaces than recipes using tabs "correctly".

Advantage with this is that if you backport patch with different whitespace,
worse you can cause is few spaces in shell task in danny recipe.

That's why I was asking to change styleguide and allow new metadata to
be submitted with spaces, as it's only aestetic so changing styleguide
wouldn't force to change every recipe (the same as many recipes having
RDEPENDS next to DEPENDS instead of near the end of file next to
do_package and FILES_ etc.).=20
