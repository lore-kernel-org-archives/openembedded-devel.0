That's what we currently have implemented and running in field for a =
while with a small difference:

1) We don't use Stefano Babic's software updater, but an own script =
which deals with initial software flash and later update similar - =
https://github.com/rdm-dev/meta-jens/tree/jethro/recipes-rdm/prd
2) We have integrated the updater with an update-service which can =
download the new image and install based on a manifest (signature =
support comes with next update) - =
https://github.com/rdm-dev/meta-jens/tree/jethro/recipes-rdm/system-image =
// http://www.netbsd.org/~sno/talks/nrpm/Moo-at-System-Image-Update.pdf
3) We use

boot
rootfs
maintfs
data

This layout allows us to extend data to fit the entire storage with know =
sizes for boot, rootfs and maintfs

4) Overlayfs with all serices is implemented (Update-wise, when coming =
from 3.10 to 3.18 or coming from 3.0 with unionfs to overlay ...) - =
https://github.com/rdm-dev/meta-jens/tree/jethro/recipes-core/initoverlay

Feel free to use that solution if you want.

Cheers
