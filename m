We're also seeing:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/main/builders/build-appliance/builds/15/steps/BuildImages_1/logs/stdio

which turns out to be triggered by the libc change (I confirmed on a
local build). I haven't looked into why. There is also a similar issue
from the synaptics driver.

Cheers,
