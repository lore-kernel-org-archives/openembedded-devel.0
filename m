meta-mmmpi can go, I haven't updated it in over 2 years, SRC_URI links
are out-of-date and it almost certainly won't compile against recent
releases.

Perhaps "last updated" could be used to nudge layer maintainers when a
layer looks stale. An automated email could tell them to check in to
confirm that the layer is still valid or let you know that it can be
removed.

Thanks,
