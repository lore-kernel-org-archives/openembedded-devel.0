Raw Transcript:


(9:05:32 AM) RP: Who do we have?
(9:05:54 AM) Jefro: I am in another phone meeting concurrently but
will stay on here for notes. Agenda at http://pastebin.com/rF7Hppaf
(note: I switched New & Lingering issues)
(9:07:06 AM) koen: present
(9:07:48 AM) RP: I'm also double booked. This week is crzay crazy
crazy for meetings :(
(9:07:53 AM) RP: Do we have much to talk about
(9:07:58 AM) RP: fray: ping?
(9:08:01 AM) RP: bluelightning: ping?
(9:08:22 AM) bluelightning: I wanted to raise OE patchwork
(9:08:29 AM) bluelightning: specifically the queue
(9:08:34 AM) koen: judging from the agenda, no new items
(9:09:03 AM) RP: 1.4 update: I think we're good to go with the branch
as it stands now
(9:09:08 AM) RP: er, 1.3 update
(9:10:53 AM) RP: and 1.4 is open for development now and work has started
(9:11:47 AM) koen: hmm, that means I need to send a "volunteers
wanted" mail for meta-oe 1.3 branch
(9:12:44 AM) koen: shall we skip to patchworK?
(9:12:58 AM) bluelightning: I'll assume so
(9:13:09 AM) bluelightning: I had a massive clearout of patchwork the other day
(9:13:19 AM) koen: yay!
(9:13:34 AM) bluelightning: got rid of about 3 pages of
merged/superseded/invalid stuff
(9:14:05 AM) bluelightning: so what we're left with is a number of
patches for OE-Classic which I'm not sure what we want to do with
(9:14:08 AM) koen: the git hooks only catch about 80% of the patches
and only for master
(9:14:27 AM) bluelightning: and some unmerged patches for meta-oe some
of which go back a few months
(9:15:36 AM) bluelightning: koen: indeed... do you know how it does
the comparison?
(9:15:41 AM) RP: are we talking about oe-core or oe-classic here?
(9:16:03 AM) koen: bluelightning: no, but iirc it's the script that
comes with patchwork
(9:16:13 AM) bluelightning: RP: we're talking about the OE patchwork
which includes patches for OE-Classic, meta-oe and other layers on top
of OE-Core that aren't OE-Core
(9:16:16 AM) koen: bluelightning: it is know to fail with accented names
(9:16:33 AM) koen: known*
(9:16:55 AM) RP: bluelightning: So what is the question?
(9:17:01 AM) bluelightning: koen: ok, I was wondering if for example
it handled additional signed-off-by being added
(9:17:33 AM) bluelightning: RP: there are two questions: 1) can we
deal with the queue of meta-oe patches especially the old ones
(9:17:56 AM) bluelightning: and 2) what do we do with the OE-Classic
patches? is it worth keeping them around?
(9:18:05 AM) bluelightning: some of them were never replied to
(9:18:10 AM) RP: Is anyone using oe-classic now?
(9:18:19 AM) bluelightning: RP: I suspect they still are yes
(9:18:30 AM) bluelightning: s/they/a number of people/
(9:18:38 AM) RP: someone needs to step up to do the work, that is the
main problem
(9:19:07 AM) RP: and I don't know who would have time/enough interest
to do it :(
(9:20:09 AM) bluelightning: I'm happy to spend time on this, what is
missing is the mandate
(9:20:15 AM) bluelightning: for 1) the question is for those that
haven't had feedback are they acceptable to be merged or not?
(9:20:37 AM) bluelightning: or have they just been missed?
(9:21:04 AM) RP: bluelightning: a question for koen I think...
(9:21:15 AM) ***RP isn't sure anyone else has the context
(9:21:22 AM) koen: most likely they have been missed
(9:21:42 AM) koen: I usually wait a few days and if they don't get
feedback -> apply
(9:22:09 AM) koen: bluelightning: the addition of SOBs and acks
happens when downloading the patch from patchwork, not in the git hook
(9:22:32 AM) khem
[~khem@99-57-140-209.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net] entered the
room.
(9:22:33 AM) mode (+v khem) by ChanServ
(9:22:41 AM) bluelightning: koen: yes, I mean is the additional
signed-off-by enough to convince the hook script that the patch is
different
(9:23:17 AM) khem: good morning guys
(9:23:23 AM) khem: I am a bit late :)
(9:23:28 AM) bluelightning: hi khem
(9:23:30 AM) koen: bluelightning: I think it copes with that
(9:23:36 AM) bluelightning: koen: ok
(9:24:34 AM) bluelightning: koen: so will you have time to go through
what is left in patchwork for meta-oe?
(9:26:15 AM) koen: yes
(9:27:20 AM) bluelightning: great, thanks... let me know if you would
like me to help at all
(9:27:40 AM) RP: hi khem, we don't appear to be having a meeting that
is structured particularly well today
(9:27:47 AM) RP: several of us are being pulled in different directions
(9:27:51 AM) khem: bluelightning: your patch is big I think its being
ignored by pw we have had such issues in past
(9:28:05 AM) bluelightning: khem: oh well, hopefully koen sees it anyway ;)
(9:28:15 AM) khem: RP: yes me too :)
(9:28:29 AM) khem: bluelightning: sometimes I have to send pull requests
(9:28:33 AM) khem: for meta-oe
(9:28:38 AM) khem: just for reasons
(9:28:51 AM) bluelightning: I usually use pull requests but for single
patches I'm a bit lazy
(9:28:55 AM) koen: bluelightning: if the coverletter shows up, I see it
(9:29:08 AM) koen: bluelightning: cc me directly if you want to make sure :)
(9:29:36 AM) bluelightning: koen: ok, I'll keep that in mind, thanks
(9:30:12 AM) khem: RP: I mentioned this issue with multimachine builds
where uderlying arch is same e.g. many intel machines or say armv7
based machines. Is this a model we intend to make work
(9:30:25 AM) khem: or what is recommendation there
(9:30:46 AM) RP: khem: Its a bug we need to find and fix
(9:30:53 AM) RP: khem: I was meaning to reply
(9:30:55 AM) khem: RP: hmm OK
(9:31:26 AM) khem: I kind of need to solve this problem if its a bug
them I dont have to change the deploying design
(9:31:34 AM) bluelightning: for 2) the OE-Classic patches I guess I'll
send out an email to the list
(9:31:36 AM) khem: thanks
(9:31:48 AM) RP: bluelightning: sounds like a good plan
(9:32:05 AM) khem: bluelightning: OE-Classic patches I think only the
release branch is active
(9:32:25 AM) khem: bluelightning: are there more ?
(9:32:36 AM) bluelightning: khem: right, the general call would be "if
anyone wants these, please repost for the maintenance branch"
(9:32:43 AM) bluelightning: khem: more?
(9:33:09 AM) khem: I thought you were addressing to some pending patches
(9:33:24 AM) khem: Tom R has been taking good care of release branch
(9:33:34 AM) bluelightning: khem: indeed he has
(9:33:36 AM) khem: it still builds on ubuntu 12.10
(9:33:53 AM) khem: I just built angstrom 2010 a week ago
(9:34:07 AM) bluelightning: khem: there's a queue of patches that were
apparently posted for master though
(9:34:26 AM) bluelightning: khem: have a look at the recently cleaned
patchwork queue and you'll see what I mean
(9:34:33 AM) khem: bluelightning: we should guide the submitter to
post against release branch yes
(9:34:40 AM) khem: if there is a need
(9:34:49 AM) khem: for those in branch
(9:34:59 AM) khem: bluelightning: ah ok :)
(9:36:26 AM) bluelightning: so, should we go through the rest of the agenda?
(9:36:38 AM) khem: have we discussed merging systemd into master post 1.3
(9:37:15 AM) bluelightning: it's been alluded to in past meetings
(9:37:21 AM) RP: khem: its on the 1.4 feature list
(9:41:10 AM) RP: So anything else we need to talk about?
(9:41:22 AM) bluelightning: going through the agenda: 2a I think was
handled last time
(9:41:22 AM) RP: Sorry I'm getting a bit distracted
(9:41:33 AM) RP: yes
(9:41:46 AM) bluelightning: Any comments on 2b?
(9:41:49 AM) RP: I think 2b/c are in progress, not much to talk about
(9:42:37 AM) bluelightning: ok, let's skip to 3d then (3 a-c seem to
be just reminders)
(9:42:41 AM) RP: no change on any of 3) either
(9:42:53 AM) RP: I've not had any time for 3d, we probably need to set
a date.time
(9:42:59 AM) bluelightning: RP: do we want to schedule any time at or
around ELCE for the OE wiki or do you want to do it before then?
(9:43:23 AM) RP: bluelightning: You know my travel schedule, I'm not
sure I will have time any time soon :(
(9:43:46 AM) bluelightning: right, let's just assume it will be at ELCE then
(9:43:58 AM) bluelightning: I'll try to get make a start beforehand
(9:44:17 AM) bluelightning: RP: anything on 4a?
(9:44:32 AM) RP: bluelightning: I covered that at the start
(9:44:50 AM) RP: The issues were addressed with ARM, -rc4 is a lot better
(9:44:56 AM) RP: should be released on time
(9:45:14 AM) bluelightning: ok; 4b: infrastructure... any comments?
(9:46:47 AM) bluelightning: no?
(9:47:15 AM) bluelightning: ok, let's move on to 4c then
(9:47:37 AM) bluelightning: anything further for the 1.4 planning?
(9:50:28 AM) Jefro: the 1.4 list is just a bucket to put things in & a
reminder to put things in it
(9:50:54 AM) bluelightning: ok, I guess if anyone has any feature
requests they haven't already filed, get them in ASAP
(9:52:07 AM) RP: yes, I'd second that
(9:56:12 AM) bluelightning: ok, 5 minutes left, anything else? or
should we just close it there?
(9:56:23 AM) bluelightning: well, 4 minutes
(9:56:38 AM) RP: I don't have anything
(9:58:19 AM) bluelightning: ok, let's call it there... thanks all
(10:02:18 AM) RP: thanks all
