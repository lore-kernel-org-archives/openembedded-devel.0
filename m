I agree with the worry that this could turn into a junkyard. The
problem is, the junk is currently mixed in with the good recipes.

That would probably make more sense.

Having a more focussed build would help but I can't really give any
ability to debug it on the machine I run builds on and I don't really
have time to debug much myself. It would literally just be a status
and a set of logs for a different config.

I think we need to prioritise what needs fixing first. I think doing a
build of meta-oe only with no PACKAGECONFIG changes, disabling
anything that requires PACKAGECONFIG changes, for qemuarm and qemux86
(and qemux86_64 if I have time) would be a good start to see what
fails in that case. Then step out to further layers once meta-oe is
green.
