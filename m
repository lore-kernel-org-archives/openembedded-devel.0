Where is the image stored? I read over referred =
http://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/
and realized that the update image must include a stripped rootfs and =
the entire
software for rootfs as well as probably the recoveryfs/maintfs and some =
logic
for updating the data volume (eg. migrator for database of business =
logic).

This can be very large ... and must be stored somewhere.

Next question: how bullet proof is the swupdate?

Out process is designed (because of typical users can't interact) to can =
survive
surprising power outage. Unfortunately we didn't manage to split out =
u-boot into
separate updatable parts, so we can't benefit from it - but technically =
(if one
has implemented for heir targets), our script updates and continues =
after power
comes back.

I think, beside the question of having an image containing the update =
(we have such
an add-on, too - for legacy devices without he modern Yocto based =
firmware), the
question of stability should be evaluated, too.
