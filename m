In future can we please discuss this on the oe-core list or at least
give a heads up there as this is pretty key to the core of the project
and we've implicitly agreed to discuss architecture there? I appreciate
this affects oe-devel layer maintainers too.

You're missing d) which would presumably be everything not in a-c) e.g.
binary graphics libs which aren't bbappends.

I have a feeling this will break more than it solves so I'm not keen on
this and I think we need to dig deeper into the problem and find a
better solution.

Could we undergo some mass purge of PRINC from master branches and then
change the PR values once and for all in the core recipes? We could make
PRINC throw a bb.fatal() from that point onwards.

and force enable the PR backwards check? Again, I think the people
you're trying to target to fix these issues are also the people who'd
probably not have the history around to see the issues that most bother
you.

I agree there are some issues here but I think we're going to need a
more creative fix.

My personal view is we need to reduce the number of bbappends. One way
to do this is to make a general/central bsp-files type recipe which
generates all the standard packages (tscalibration data, xorg config and
all the other single machine specific config files).

Yes, this would be a disruptive change but it would significantly clean
up the BSP layers and hopefully make maintenance easier. It is on the
Yocto project proposed features list although we've only got the idea,
we haven't discussed with the community etc. Now would see as good a
time as any.

We have talked about a version wildcard for bbappend. You are still at
the mercy of what the bbappend does though (e.g. when I include
meta-raspberrypi, it changes the psplash logo, regardless of whether I'm
building for the pi).

In many ways the bbappend is too easy and encourages anti-social
behaviour. I would recommend bouncing meta-rpi as being non yocto
project compatible due to the psplash issue if it were to apply which it
has not.

How many layers apply for that status though?

I think Paul had good feedback here.

I do appreciate understanding where some of the problem arises from,
thanks!
