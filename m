I put this through the autobuilder and it passed so I've merged it. I
did this quickly as we're putting a "pre M3" build through a QA cycle
and I wanted to get some of the more invasive changes into that build
so we don't have a stampeding herd of patches breaking everything
coming up to the final feature freeze for 2.2.

In other news, we are now also testing musl world builds on the
autobuilder as part of regular testing.

Cheers,

Richard
