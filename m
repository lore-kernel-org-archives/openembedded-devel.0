Well, this reminds me of numerous discussions we've had in the past at several 
OEDEMs and OEDAMs about maintainers file and requirements/responsibilities it 
carries - unfortunately we never been able to resolve it one way or another. I 
guess we'll try finalizing it again with the renewed effort now...


As of u-boot - wasn't trying to claim ownership at all. In the past we've had 
a number of updates from TI, as it's a bootloader of choice for our platforms. 
Somehow I got assigned as a maintainer for the corresponding recipes. I know 
Otavio is also responsible for some changes there, from his involvement with 
Freescale. And at OEDEM last fall, I had a good conversation with Marek about 
u-boot recipes, we've discussed restructuring and re-versioning plans and 
since then he's copying me on his updates - I'm trying to review and/or test 
his changes as much as I can. That's all to it.
