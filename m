CC:ing oe-core since we have kernel.bbclass patches there as well.

DMAI and gst-ti don't really work with anything newer than 2.6.32-psp, =
we're trying to get that addressed internally.

I don't really have a better suggestion, apart from adding a var in e.g. =
bitbake.conf to point to the userspace stuff.

We might even do the reverse, stage the full set into =
$kernel_dir/private and the userspace ones in $kernel_dir, that would =
make it more clear which recipes need internal API.
