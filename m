hi there,

we have put in place a dashboard that shows our community engagement and
stats. We are using a service from Bitergia for that, and they are using
open source tools from the LF CHAOSS project [1].

The dashboard is publicly available at [2]. Feel free to have a look at the
data, the tool is doing its best to map users' identities (email, git,
bugzilla, ...). It also tries to map when possible users with their
respective company/employer, so that gives everyone a map of who
contributes and participate to the project.

If you have any questions or issues with the tool, please let me know.  If
any mailing list or git tree is missing and you would like it to be added,
let me know and I will do it.

If you want to update your data on the dashboard such as typo, or if you
want to show (or update, or hide) your employer affiliation, or if you want
to anonymise your data on the public dashboard, please reach out to me as
well.

cheers
nicolas
