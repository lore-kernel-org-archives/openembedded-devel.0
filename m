Ok, so on the second day it failed again on weston-init and couple of our own 
packages. They are all marked as allarch, but it seems they get re-packaged 
for some reason for different machines in multi-machine build - the timestamp 
of the ipk package changed, while nothing else in the recipe or its data has 
changed. There's nothing obvious in weston-init I can see that would trigger 
it. And in the logs I see that do_package_write_ipk_setscene being triggered - 
I'm trying to figure out why... Any pointers?
