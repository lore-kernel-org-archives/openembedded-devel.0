I sent patches for meta-openembedded, but I am not sure how to build
meta-atmel:

bitbake libegl
ERROR: Layer atmel is not compatible with the core layer which only
supports these series: honister (layer is compatible with hardknott)

But the fix is probably the same as the ones I sent for the other
packages (which I copied from
meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-protocols/net-snmp/net-snmp_5.9.1.bb).
