=> jefro to follow up with scottrif DONE
=> khem to fix the oe wiki and reminder to ml
possible to move server at some point?
=> jefro to investigate YP hosting, kernel.org mirror

Raw Transcript

(9:00:32 AM) mode (+v Jefro) by ChanServ
(9:00:47 AM) Jefro: Khem is stuck in traffic, will be 15-20 mins late
(9:00:59 AM) Jefro: I'm finishing up the agenda, 1-2 mins
(9:01:17 AM) ***RP_ is here
(9:01:26 AM) ***bluelightning is here
(9:01:34 AM) fray: here
(9:06:12 AM) Jefro: good morning - so just missing koen and khem
(9:06:24 AM) Jefro: khem will be here in 10-15 mins
(9:06:24 AM) koen: 17:46 < koen> I have a conflict at 6, I'll be
attending the meeting sporadically, my apologies
(9:06:27 AM) RP_: Jefro: "(16:47:01) koen: I have a conflict at 6,
I'll be attending the meeting sporadically, my apologies"
(9:06:36 AM) Jefro: ah, got it thanks
(9:06:38 AM) ***koen just walked into the office again
(9:06:42 AM) Jefro: agenda here:  http://pastebin.com/mBhCDqR2
(9:06:57 AM) RP_: I actually cancelled other stuff so I could attend
this meeting
(9:07:48 AM) fray: UK is on day light savings now?
(9:08:01 AM) RP_: fray: yes
(9:08:01 AM) bluelightning: yes
(9:08:24 AM) fray: I assume central europe is as well then.. so we're
all back to the same relative time zones at least
(9:08:37 AM) RP_: fray: yes, it helps
(9:08:59 AM) RP_: So, should I chair for a change?
(9:09:08 AM) RP_: I think its probably my turn
(9:09:11 AM) ***fray is fine with that
(9:09:16 AM) bluelightning: me too
(9:09:35 AM) RP_: I assume we get started and khem can catch up when he joins
(9:09:42 AM) RP_: Any additions to the agenda
(9:09:44 AM) RP_: ?
(9:09:55 AM) fray: One thing, discussion on "the next release"..
(9:10:16 AM) fray: if any.. I'm more thinking about plans like gcc 4.8
and stuff like that after the upcoming release..
(9:10:38 AM) bluelightning: fray: I guess you saw khem already has a
patchset for that
(9:10:39 AM) koen: fray: like bluez5 and gst 1.x?
(9:10:40 AM) fray: (and BTW I'm happy if we say there isn't anything
to talk about yet)  :)
(9:10:44 AM) RP_: ok
(9:10:52 AM) fray: bluelightning yup.. :)
(9:11:01 AM) fray: koen, ya exactly..
(9:11:07 AM) RP_: So, updates on section 3
(9:11:12 AM) RP_: Anything on 3a?
(9:11:28 AM) bluelightning: yep, it's now in the manual
(9:11:37 AM) fray: cool, we can drop the item?
(9:11:41 AM) RP_: bluelightning: great! :)
(9:11:49 AM) bluelightning: some extensions needed so we fully cover
what to do with ipk but the material info is there
(9:11:51 AM) RP_: bluelightning: can we consider that closed now?
(9:11:56 AM) bluelightning: yep I think so
(9:12:05 AM) RP_: great! :)
(9:12:08 AM) RP_: I still need to sort out 3b, been distracted with the release
(9:12:27 AM) RP_: which brings us to systemd
(9:12:38 AM) RP_: I think things there are pretty clear on the mailing list
(9:12:52 AM) RP_: I've not managed the status emails we've talked
about yet but still plan to
(9:13:17 AM) RP_: Anything anyone wants to add?
(9:13:26 AM) Jefro: my action item is not yet done
(9:14:19 AM) bluelightning: RP_: we need to ensure the
sysvinit/systemd stuff is fully documented and I think Ross and Scott
are taking care of that
(9:14:23 AM) RP_: We did see some favouritism comments in irc however
when looked into, most of the patches which were supposedly being
ignored had in fact been merged
(9:15:01 AM) RP_: We don't send out the "merged" replies now which
perhaps doesn't help perception
(9:15:42 AM) RP_: For 3d, any update?
(9:15:59 AM) Jefro: I did follow up with scottrif
(9:16:10 AM) RP_: bluelightning: yes, agreed. I know I've sent some
fixes to Scott about the systemd docs too
(9:16:31 AM) RP_: (I passed on some reports on irc to be clear)
(9:16:56 AM) bluelightning: someone claimed that github was lagging
behind at one point
(9:17:05 AM) bluelightning: I did not follow up on the claim but it
concerned me at the time...
(9:17:23 AM) RP_: bluelightning: :/
(9:18:15 AM) RP_: bluelightning: I guess we should check it has caught up...
(9:18:57 AM) bluelightning: OE-Core is up-to-date at this moment at least
(9:19:13 AM) RP_: bluelightning: ok, that is good at least...
(9:19:14 AM) fray: I saw that (github) a few weeks ago.. and it caught
up pretty quickly.. and it was up to date within 15 minutes..
(9:19:20 AM) bluelightning: could have been a hiccup during the
infrastructure issues we had about a week ago
(9:19:24 AM) RP_: Moving to 4a, OE-Core release status
(9:19:24 AM) fray: since then, I havn't noticed the lag.. so I think
it was a hickup
(9:19:54 AM) RP_: We've had serious issues with the new autobuilder
infrastructure highlighting existing race issues and qemu bugs
(9:20:12 AM) RP_: I'm hoping today that we nailed down the last one of
those but its been causing me some serious stress :/
(9:20:42 AM) bluelightning: we're probably one of the few using that
code I suspect
(9:20:54 AM) bluelightning: FWIW, it's not documented other than
what's in local.conf.sample
(9:21:04 AM) bluelightning: (qemuimagetest I mean)
(9:21:13 AM) RP_: There are a number of other issues out there, some
kernel issues with routerstationpro, udev and multilib issues, there
have also been a number of fixes going into master for things like
CVEs
(9:21:29 AM) RP_: and the postinst issues of where there have been several
(9:21:57 AM) RP_: bluelightning: qemuimagetest isn't going to be worth
documenting in its current form now as it will change in 1.5 quite
massively
(9:22:07 AM) bluelightning: RP_: ok
(9:22:09 AM) RP_: bluelightning: and yes, we're clearly the main
people using it.
(9:22:12 AM) khem
[~khem@99-57-140-209.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net] entered the
room.
(9:22:13 AM) mode (+v khem) by ChanServ
(9:22:18 AM) fray: hey
(9:22:19 AM) khem: hrmpp
(9:22:22 AM) khem: I am here
(9:22:28 AM) RP_: That code does help us a lot with our testing and is
extremely important
(9:22:30 AM) bluelightning: khem: we are on 4a OE-Core release status
(9:22:31 AM) RP_: hi khem
(9:22:38 AM) RP_: khem: agenda: http://pastebin.com/mBhCDqR2
(9:22:44 AM) RP_: khem: We're talking about 4a
(9:22:51 AM) fray: ya.. it helps keep the quality level up.. and is
something we need to keep using, even if the project itself is the
only user
(9:23:01 AM) fray: (even though it apparently isn't foolproof)  :(
(9:23:09 AM) RP_: fray: Plans in 1.5 are to integrate a lot more into it
(9:23:22 AM) bluelightning: it's crucial, and we need to be doing even
more runtime testing
(9:23:23 AM) RP_: fray: automate a lot more of the manual QA into
there and add -ptest support etc
(9:23:37 AM) khem: ok
(9:23:38 AM) RP_: but for 1.4, I'm hoping we have this stablised for now
(9:23:51 AM) fray: my concern when it comes to qemu and integration is
handling architectures that QEMU doesn't support (or processor
optimizations).. but as long as the fall back continues..  I do like
that qemu helps us with testing, etc..
(9:23:51 AM) RP_: We're also having to backport the fixes for it to 1.3.x
(9:23:57 AM) fray: the ptest stuff is really a nice addition as well
(9:24:14 AM) RP_: fray: the fallback is how we'd handle that, yes
(9:24:23 AM) khem: w.r.t. ptest is there some document on it
(9:24:28 AM) fray: RP_, ya so from a technical direction, I think
we're doing the right things..
(9:24:38 AM) khem: like what differnet packages are currently ptestifies
(9:24:42 AM) bluelightning: khem: no, but I have pinged Bjorn about that today
(9:24:47 AM) khem: and what can one do to add more
(9:24:51 AM) fray: (might even spur some BSP writings to improve QEMU
for their specific processors)
(9:24:57 AM) bluelightning: khem: I suggested he talk to Scott about
getting that in
(9:24:57 AM) RP_: so, 1.4 is in its final stages, I was extremely
nervous about it, I'm less nervous today but still not entirely
comfortable
(9:25:37 AM) RP_: khem: at this point I think those things will have
to be a specific objective of 1.5
(9:25:39 AM) fray: RP_, if it makes you feel any better.. the work
I've been doing on master has shown that it's way better then 1.2 and
1.3 were (in hindsight)..
(9:26:04 AM) RP_: fray: that is good, I'd hate the opposite to be true! :)
(9:26:20 AM) RP_: Any concerns/questions with 1.4?
(9:26:34 AM) khem: RP_: yes thats more of doc/wiki issue so not as
much important for release
(9:26:59 AM) RP_: khem: there is a chance we may still be able to sort
that for the release, we'll see
(9:27:13 AM) RP_: khem: I want to turn the eglibc/gcc tests into ptest btw :)
(9:27:41 AM) khem: RP_: yes thats what I was leaning towards
(9:27:43 AM) RP_: khem:
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4216 may make
interesting reading for you btw - that sanity issue I mentioned
(9:28:24 AM) RP_: khem: any update on 4b? (mailing list migration) ?
(9:28:43 AM) RP_: 4c I think progress is clear on the mailing list, it
will be in 1.4
(9:29:01 AM) khem: RP_: thats cool fix
(9:29:02 AM) RP_: Jefro: 4b and 4d are the same?
(9:29:04 AM) bluelightning: we desperately need to move forward on
that, mailing lists broke again last week (at least the web archive
did)
(9:29:22 AM) Jefro: 4b is a  placeholder, 4d has matured into its own project
(9:29:23 AM) fray: bluelightning did it ever get fixed (web archives)?
(9:29:27 AM) khem: RP_: I have been looking at qemu commits on master
for some hints but could not spend lot of time
(9:29:33 AM) bluelightning: fray: yes they are working now
(9:29:36 AM) fray: good
(9:29:37 AM) Jefro: I have a small update on 4d - Tom is working with
Florian and choosing between moving to OSUOSL or YP
(9:29:57 AM) Jefro: so it is in progress
(9:29:57 AM) bluelightning: Jefro: great!
(9:30:04 AM) RP_: Jefro: If we were to go the YP route, Michael would
be able to help FWIW
(9:30:05 AM) fray: excellent
(9:30:42 AM) RP_: Michael is invaluable, keeps all the infrastructure going
(9:30:55 AM) Jefro: I agree, although I think Tom is choosing OSUOSL -
I haven't talked to him in detail about why that is, but he knows YP
is an option
(9:31:20 AM) RP_: We've been an AB down due to memory issues recently
and the recent power upgrade was a small outage but in general we do
really well with uptime
(9:31:41 AM) khem: Jefro: Tom King ?
(9:31:54 AM) RP_: Jefro: I just hope we're not swapping one set of
problems for another, it worries me when things take a while :/
(9:32:00 AM) khem: Jefro: I will talk to him, I think yp will support
it lot better than osuosl
(9:32:20 AM) khem: not thst osuosl is bad
(9:32:38 AM) khem: I have experience handling uclibc stuff
(9:32:43 AM) khem: with osuosl
(9:33:24 AM) RP_: khem: I guess some of us appear biased so please do
talk to him :)
(9:34:04 AM) RP_: The YP is big enough now that the LF wouldn't let it
just disappear overnight
(9:34:07 AM) khem: RP_: I wil
(9:34:23 AM) khem: even if it did we can find alternatives
(9:34:37 AM) khem: and we can defer it to when it happens
(9:34:45 AM) RP_: khem: right, exactly
(9:35:04 AM) RP_: bluelightning: any update on 4e?
(9:35:13 AM) khem: I think we can benefit from Michael's promptness
(9:35:44 AM) bluelightning: RP_: I sent out the patchset, I have to
send a v2 preserving the bbappends with only PRINC settings left in
(9:35:59 AM) bluelightning: which I am not particularly happy about,
but I can accept it for the moment
(9:36:13 AM) RP_: bluelightning: sounds like progress is being made
(9:36:18 AM) bluelightning: yes
(9:36:28 AM) bluelightning: we still have a bbappend for busybox that
I don't fully understand
(9:36:36 AM) RP_: bluelightning: I'd hope they can removed entirely
with some PR bumps eventually
(9:36:48 AM) fray: bluelightning is it configuration specific or something else?
(9:37:07 AM) bluelightning: RP_: that was NACKed because "we can't
guarantee which version of OE-Core is being used with meta-oe master"
(9:37:33 AM) bluelightning: when PV is bumped we can definitely drop them though
(9:37:34 AM) RP_: bluelightning: :(
(9:37:51 AM) RP_: bluelightning: right, so we have a plan to kill them off :)
(9:37:51 AM) fray: Hmm..  meta-oe moving forward will eventually need
the master or "last release"?
(9:37:55 AM) bluelightning: RP_: right
(9:38:18 AM) khem: bluelightning: that syslog thing for busybox is for
systemd to let it use
(9:38:21 AM) RP_: I'll insert 4f, 1.5 planning
(9:38:24 AM) RP_: fray: ?
(9:38:27 AM) bluelightning: it's also worth noting there was a
follow-up discussion about how to handle optional dependencies from
stuff in OE-Core on other things that aren't
(9:38:38 AM) bluelightning: khem: so we probably need it in OE-Core right?
(9:38:42 AM) khem: otherwise it segfaults
(9:38:47 AM) bluelightning: ???!!!
(9:38:49 AM) khem: I guess so
(9:38:49 AM) fray: Sure.. briefly.. there are a few key things I'd
like to mention on the 1.5 planning.. subsystems, and other things
that we should "plan" to update
(9:38:50 AM) bluelightning: segfaults?
(9:38:54 AM) RP_: bluelightning: Although I didn't reply, I support
the PACKAGECONFIG proposal
(9:38:57 AM) fray: i.e. gcc 4.8, gstreamer, bluez..
(9:39:19 AM) fray: I assume the general rule of follow the open source
world forward still applies, so I don't know if there is as much
planning needed on any of those as was on systemd..
(9:39:29 AM) bluelightning: khem: if it's really a segfaulting problem
we really do need that in for 1.4
(9:39:31 AM) khem: I think OE-Core should use defaults that are with
in its own layer
(9:39:36 AM) khem: and provide knobs
(9:39:39 AM) fray: but is it reasoanble to move plan to move to 4.8,
1.0, 5 respectively?  (anything else)?
(9:39:42 AM) khem: so others can turn on or off
(9:39:45 AM) bluelightning: khem: that's the suggested course
(9:39:46 AM) RP_: fray: the issue with bluez and gst are the parallel
installation
(9:39:54 AM) RP_: fray: I think we have good plans on the mailing list though
(9:40:03 AM) koen: bluez, not gst
(9:40:07 AM) koen: gst is parallel installable
(9:40:09 AM) koen: bluez isn't
(9:40:18 AM) fray: that's what I was thinking.. bluez is going to be an issue..
(9:40:24 AM) RP_: koen: right, but there are plans for both on the
mailing list though
(9:40:28 AM) fray: unless we have all of the users updated -- or some
kind of a compatibility shim
(9:41:03 AM) fray: does anyone know (at this point) any other major
version changes that could affect people?
(9:41:32 AM) RP_: khem: what is glicb doing in the 1.5 timescale?
(9:41:59 AM) khem: RP_: I dont think we will make all eglibc patches
into glibc by them
(9:42:00 AM) khem: then
(9:42:11 AM) RP_: we have the 4.8 gcc branch so that is progressing well too
(9:42:19 AM) khem: RP_: I will talk to carlos when I am at Collab
(9:42:27 AM) RP_: khem: the 2.17 issue caused some segfaults in crypt :/
(9:42:32 AM) fray: (gcc 4.8 doesn't worry me.. we'll get the issues
resolved by then)
(9:42:47 AM) RP_: khem: an update on the plans there would be good
(9:42:52 AM) ***fray notes he was really surprised to hear crypt
behavior changed
(9:43:12 AM) RP_: fray: I don't know of any other major version changes
(9:43:21 AM) fray: are there any other architectures coming in for
1.5?  (aarch64?)
(9:43:40 AM) RP_: there is talk about the qemuppc64 and qemumips64
(9:43:52 AM) RP_: I'd imagine we'll continue to see aarch64 patches dribbling in
(9:43:55 AM) fray: that would be nice..
(9:44:13 AM) RP_: I think the YP angle on this is we need more
autobuilder hardware
(9:44:24 AM) RP_: but there is a case of adding those machines to OE-Core
(9:44:25 AM) khem: fray: yes I will do provide summary in next TSC
(9:44:27 AM) fray: my concern w/ aarch64 is simply that if we get a
referecne machine (qemu?) then we're going to need autobuilder time
and such.. and new arch's generally find bugs.. :0
(9:44:31 AM) bluelightning: there's the possibility of Qt 5 for 1.5 as well
(9:44:39 AM) bluelightning: I'm still disconnected from that
(9:44:47 AM) bluelightning: but work has been progressing thanks to others
(9:44:52 AM) RP_: fray: someone will have to sponsor AB resources and
some QA to make that happen
(9:44:52 AM) fray: bluelightning ahh.. good point.. I had someone ask
me about Qt 5 the other day as well
(9:45:00 AM) fray: RP_ ok
(9:45:29 AM) RP_: fray: there are some YP members interested in the
other qemu64 I mentioned so those are less of an issue
(9:45:59 AM) fray: So one other thing..  I've mentioned this before
briefly on IRC..  during 1.5, we should look at getting rid of
'native' and moving everything to 'nativesdk'.. remvoe duplication
(9:46:10 AM) RP_: fray: no
(9:46:23 AM) fray: (I have no idea at this point if it's reasonable in
that time frame, but on the surface it looks that way to me)
(9:46:37 AM) RP_: fray: there are some deep technical issues in doing that
(9:46:50 AM) RP_: native assumes the host libc, nativesdk builds its own
(9:46:56 AM) fray: All of the ones I knew of had been resolved..
(9:47:19 AM) RP_: fray: nativesdk is done as a cross, you need the
native tools to support the cross build
(9:47:23 AM) fray: I thoguht we wanted to use the build eglibc to
avoid more problems..
(9:47:41 AM) RP_: fray: no, where did you get than from?
(9:48:06 AM) fray: people complaing that -native's are breaking on
upgrade or trying to reuse sstate between machines
(9:48:15 AM) RP_: fray: didn't we fix that?
(9:48:42 AM) fray: I'm talking about upgrading the host.. not OE-core
(9:48:50 AM) RP_: fray: I know
(9:49:00 AM) fray: if we did fix it, I'm not aware of it
(9:49:15 AM) RP_: We inject the LSB release strings into the sstate location
(9:49:17 AM) fray: (I'm also not completely aware of the problems
people were reporting.. what the actual bugs were)
(9:49:44 AM) bluelightning: which include the version...
(9:49:49 AM) RP_: fray: this sounds like something which needs more
detailed analysis
(9:49:52 AM) fray: "sometimes"
(9:50:02 AM) bluelightning: yes, more details needed
(9:50:05 AM) fray: RP- agree.. only bringing it up as something to
consider at this point
(9:50:24 AM) RP_: fray: I'll just say that merging native and
nativesdk isn't feasible as I understand it at this point
(9:50:34 AM) fray: ok
(9:50:34 AM) RP_: fray: lets talk more about the specific issues in due course
(9:50:43 AM) fray: ok
(9:51:01 AM) RP_: As I mentioned earlier, automation will be a big push in 1.5
(9:51:04 AM) fray: thats it for my 1.5 topic
(9:51:08 AM) RP_: (for QA)
(9:51:28 AM) khem: brb
(9:51:30 AM) RP_: the qemuimagetest infrastructure should adapt
relatively easily to real hardware
(9:51:32 AM) fray: I'd love to see bugs get test cases written for
them as part of hte fix..  but I believe that's only a dream.. ;)
(9:51:49 AM) RP_: fray: we are in fact starting to do this in some areas
(9:51:57 AM) RP_: the fetcher for example now has a test suite
(9:52:02 AM) fray: RP_, I know.. I'm happy to see that
(9:52:24 AM) RP_: fray: I hope we'll see improvements in 1.5 :)
(9:52:49 AM) bluelightning: another thing we've talked about for 1.5
is eliminating the wrapper script (i.e. allowing re-exec within pseudo
within the build process instead of externally)
(9:52:50 AM) RP_: I know deployment is also a big thing for 1.5 -
standalone image generation from feeds and so on
(9:53:05 AM) RP_: which I know we've been able to do berfore but this
would be much enhanced
(9:53:18 AM) RP_: ah, yes. That wrapper script needs to die
(9:53:28 AM) RP_: means changing bitbake internals, not impossible
(9:53:31 AM) fray: that would be -really- nice..
(9:53:41 AM) bluelightning: right, it's not a trivial task, but worthwhile
(9:53:52 AM) RP_: oh, and the second part of this is the performance
improvement if we could leave the bitbake server resident
(9:54:18 AM) RP_: load at source the script time, then commands just
connect to it
(9:54:31 AM) RP_: should make for a lovely responsive set of commands
(9:54:50 AM) fray: (I know I'd love to be able to run bitbake on an
external machine, but have the UI local)
(9:54:58 AM) RP_: fray: you can do that today
(9:55:05 AM) fray: ya, I use SSH.. ;)
(9:55:15 AM) RP_: fray: no, it has options for it over xmlrpc
(9:55:28 AM) RP_: fray: go look at bitbake --help ;-)
(9:55:48 AM) RP_: fray: you do need to use the -t xmlrpc option
(9:55:54 AM) fray: I do regularly..... but documenting this and make
it part of a standard use... would be nice
(9:56:18 AM) RP_: ok, anything else on 1.5?
(9:56:33 AM) RP_: and anything else on the second section 4 which we
can henceforth refer to section 5
(9:56:42 AM) fray: I'm good
(9:57:04 AM) Jefro: :-/
(9:57:15 AM) RP_: I should highlight we've made some serious
performance improvements in 1.4
(9:57:24 AM) RP_: https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Performance_Test
(9:58:30 AM) RP_: size on disk is down, overall build time is down,
rm_work removes more, rootfs task is much faster
(9:58:42 AM) RP_: I'm really happy with what we've managed to do there
(9:59:03 AM) RP_: Anything else?
(9:59:28 AM) RP_: If not I will call the meeting closed!
