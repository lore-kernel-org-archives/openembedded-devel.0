So, debugging further...

weston-init RDEPENDS on weston and kbd.

$ bitbake-diffsigs 1.0-r0.do_package_write_ipk.sigdata.eb3921bfc9623056f7ffaef4be8549ab 1.0-r0.do_package_write_ipk.sigdata.90c2978497847912cd64f66039927f7d 
Hash for dependent task waylandweston_1.6.0.bb.do_packagedata changed from 551b3b5ac7b3c41bfced58b88db2d824 to f3eb9cd1861c186382e47f90e82e3295
Hash for dependent task kbdkbd_2.0.1.bb.do_packagedata changed from 53a5dc88b80dc5ab559fbecd14277650 to 950fbc7fe3c33564e781743f2c260670

Then, comparing signatures for weston, for exaple, gives all the changes 
caused by different DEFAULTTUNEs, TUNE_FEATURES and ARMPKGARCH - obviously, 
since one machine is cortexa8, while another is cortexa9.

But why would an allarch package even care about machine tunes in dependant 
packages, when it only RDEPENDS on them?

And how should I fix this? Thanks.
