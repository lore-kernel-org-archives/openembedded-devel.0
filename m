The newer code points to :

commit be8c9c382d2d1d37b51d29b0843045121ec90213
Author: iain <iain@sleepfive.com>

     Configure automake to generate .gz and .bz2 archives

This is the latest commit in the gypsy git master branch.

Also, the lastest release is pointed here :
http://gypsy.freedesktop.org/releases/

and it is on the same date as the last commit in git.

I don't really know how git recipes work, do you suggest updating the PV ?
