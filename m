Thanks for testing that, sounds like it helps that issue. I'll queue that patch.

Unfortunately even with the ruby fix I queued, we still see reproduciblity
issues with the LDFLAGS change in curl-dev, gettext-ptest, ruby and ruby-dbg 
packages:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/115/builds/515/steps/12/logs/stdio

We'll need to resolve those before I can merge the flags change.

Diffoscope output:

https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/repro-fail/oe-reproducible-20210805-8jfd55ki/packages/diff-html/

Basically LDFLAGS get encoded into a couple of scripts and the ruby binary.

Cheers,

Richard
