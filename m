Anything using internal kernel headers is effectively kernel module like
and should be using STAGING_DIR_KERNEL. There should be a complete set
of headers available there, particularly after recent improvemnents to
kernel.bbclass in oecore. Note that using kernel headers like this
effectively makes the package machine specific since the kernel is
machine specific.
