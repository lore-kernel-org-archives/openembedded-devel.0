I am sorry but I disagree. All those affect the layers and thus
changes on oe-core are important to meta-oe so they are all related.
Besides not everyone follow both.

Personally I've been following mostly oe-core and skipped oe and
someone might be doing the other way around; patch management has
nothing to do with mailing list topic and this we can assume this is
easy to fix using patchwork and proper subject on patches.
