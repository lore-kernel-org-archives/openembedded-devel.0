The flip side is that adding BSP layers becomes a lot safer. I don't =
mind adding layers. Adding layers is easy. Removing layers is pretty =
much impossible, though.

Yes, layer maintainers are proving to be the weak link is the layer =
system.

If PRSERV would work reliably we wouldn't need it. But even with the =
current flaky PRSERV PRINC is causing more problems than it's supposed =
to solve.

I personally think the overhead is worth it, but as you say, moving bits =
to package.bbclass (and maybe using a sqlite db) would be very good as =
well.

My thinking was that adding such a banner would email the maintainers of =
that layer. That still assumes that the layer maintainer actually reads =
email, which I don't think is true for a lot of layers :/
