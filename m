this TSC has operated very very differently to previous TSCs
continue as is or change
-->Koen to read up before next week
___________________________________
09) RP is also proposing that with the "distroless" configuration in place,
we're about ready to invite wider attention on OECore.
see #2 above
____________________________________
10) How should we (OE) handle non-Linux host support?  Policies, priorities,
etc.
fray: I bring this up because of the MacOS X work I did.. and now a few
other people have started in on
RP: needs to be clean, not a maintenance headache


Raw Transcript

(21:00:19) ***RP__ is here
(21:00:29) Tartarus: That's a quorum then, yeah
(21:00:43) RP__: Yes, four of us
(21:01:09) stefan_schmidt: I can chair if people like
(21:01:25) Tartarus: works for me
(21:01:26) Tartarus: thanks
(21:01:27) RP__: stefan_schmidt: no objection
(21:01:49) RP__: Jefro did send out an agenda
(21:01:51) stefan_schmidt: ok, will bring up the agenda
(21:02:02) stefan_schmidt: yeah, will but it on pastebin just as reference
(21:02:08) stefan_schmidt: with fray item added
(21:03:03) stefan_schmidt: http://pastebin.com/jTL7wr3G
(21:03:18) stefan_schmidt: We start without jefro and someone just sends him
the log?
(21:03:25) RP__: stefan_schmidt: I think so
(21:03:26) stefan_schmidt: btw, is someone logging? RP__ ?
(21:03:27) fray: seems reasonable
(21:03:32) ***RP__ has logs
(21:03:46) RP__: stefan_schmidt: I posted some additions to the agenda too?
(21:03:56) stefan_schmidt: RP__: right
(21:04:05) stefan_schmidt: i will get an updated version up
(1:06:33 PM) stefan_schmidt: http://pastebin.com/hZBRq0mS
(1:06:38 PM) stefan_schmidt: There we go
(1:06:45 PM) stefan_schmidt: Agenda with the added items
(1:06:55 PM) Jefro: stefan_schmidt awesome, thanks
(1:06:59 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: thanks :)
(1:07:06 PM) RP__: Jefro: stefan_schmidt is chair today
(1:07:12 PM) fray: :)
(1:07:17 PM) stefan_schmidt: Jefro: we agreed on me being the meeting chair
so far
(1:07:27 PM) Jefro: I gathered that. Stefan: congratulations
(1:07:36 PM) RP__: koen and khem send apologies
(1:08:11 PM) stefan_schmidt: so we are ready for take-off
(1:08:15 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: yes
(1:08:26 PM) ***stefan_schmidt stops his OE build to have better xchat
performance :)
(1:08:54 PM) stefan_schmidt: 02) OE core status update
(1:09:18 PM) ***RP__ has pushed the distroless changes
(1:09:29 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: I think you and koen had some discussions
about the gconf stuff
(1:09:44 PM) stefan_schmidt: raising points what should be in core and what
in other layers
(1:09:54 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: We did as what koen asked for conflicted
with what we'd agreed in previous tsc meetings
(1:10:04 PM) RP__: I think koen needs to be present for that discussion
though
(1:10:07 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: thanks for the distro less stuff. Great
in time for the meeting and, hopefully, the announcement
(1:10:19 PM) RP__: and neither of us see it as a blocking issue on OECore,
just needs discussion
(1:10:27 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: yeah, would make more sense
(1:11:02 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: I actually like to see such things coming
up from time to time to re-evaluate where to put things :)
(1:11:13 PM) fray: Assuming everyone is comfortable with the existing
changes, are we ready to formally announce it?  (I know we have more and
more people using it every week -- which is really good)
(1:11:42 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: I think so. We waited for distro less
last week and RP__ got it ready in time
(1:11:45 PM) Tartarus: I think we must, yes
(1:11:52 PM) RP__: fray: I was getting to this and yes, I think we're about
there for that
(1:12:08 PM) RP__: So the question really is who takes the action?
(1:12:24 PM) stefan_schmidt: nothing more to 02? Then we merge in 09 here
(1:12:24 PM) ***RP__ can make a post to oe-devel on behalf of the TSC?
(1:12:33 PM) stefan_schmidt: sounds good
(1:12:45 PM) stefan_schmidt: I think it does reflect the TSC
(1:12:58 PM) RP__: Its what we minuted last week as our plan
(1:13:04 PM) stefan_schmidt: And we where set up to bring oe-core forward so
it would be good to announce it as TSC
(1:13:17 PM) RP__: Since then we've ensured bitbake is more in sync and
removed the final poky references
(1:13:31 PM) RP__: which were the things we wanted to do before announcing
(1:13:45 PM) stefan_schmidt: we are fine I would say
(1:13:54 PM) RP__: Can we assume we trust me to write a suitable
announcement? :)
(1:14:10 PM) stefan_schmidt: I do :)
(1:14:39 PM) Tartarus: Yes, we do
(1:14:56 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: I'd take silence as acceptance ;-)
(1:15:06 PM) ***Jefro would hope so at this point
(1:15:12 PM) fray: no problem here..
(1:15:24 PM) stefan_schmidt: ok, all for it. RP__ please do it
(1:15:38 PM) stefan_schmidt: 09 done as well?
(1:15:39 PM) ***RP__ will aim to send something out tomorrow
(1:15:42 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: yes
(1:15:59 PM) stefan_schmidt: AR: (RP) write oe-core announcement for the
masses
(1:16:07 PM) RP__: For 03), there has been some discussion about pull
scripts and workflow
(1:16:21 PM) RP__: I'd suggest those discussions continue for all on the
mailing list
(1:16:32 PM) stefan_schmidt: agreed
(1:16:40 PM) Tartarus: agreed
(1:16:44 PM) fray: the discussion has been growing, and I think is headed in
the right direction -- agreed
(1:16:49 PM) stefan_schmidt: khem did finish his AR regarding the commit
scripts
(1:17:03 PM) fray: the 5th version of the commit/patch message guidelines
was just posted..
(1:17:11 PM) fray: this is close to the final version -- assuming no major
comments
(1:17:11 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: yes, we have commit emails now so
Tartarus should be happy
(1:17:35 PM) Tartarus: yes
(1:17:52 PM) fray: just one thing to mention.. Paul Menzel has made a number
of editorial comments and improvements in the guidelines as we've gone..
(1:18:01 PM) stefan_schmidt: so fray has an eye on commit guidelines and
Tartarus, khem, Daren, etc will keep discussing the pull scripts
(1:18:18 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: thats good
(1:19:34 PM) ***stefan_schmidt just notes that oe-core gets other distros
even before the announcement.(<pb_> in other news, though, I nearly have
some semblance of a working micro layer on top of oe-core.)
(1:19:57 PM) RP__: great :)
(1:20:01 PM) stefan_schmidt: 03 needs no more discussion here?
(1:20:10 PM) stefan_schmidt: Seems the current main topics are on the ml
(1:20:16 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: agreed
(1:20:27 PM) stefan_schmidt: 4) Status report on board support layer
guidelines
(1:21:02 PM) stefan_schmidt: has this moved?
(1:21:22 PM) ***RP__ doesn't know
(1:21:57 PM) stefan_schmidt: anyone has updates on this?
(1:21:59 PM) Jefro: I have an action item there to send fray a rough
document
(1:22:01 PM) Khem__ [d0dfd0f2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.208.223.208.242]
entered the room.
(1:22:08 PM) Jefro: by the end of this week - on target
(1:22:16 PM) fray: yup, so I think were slightly behind on that.. but
nothing big
(1:22:31 PM) stefan_schmidt: ok
(1:22:48 PM) stefan_schmidt: so this AR just stays and you come back next
week
(1:22:52 PM) stefan_schmidt: hi Khem__
(1:23:08 PM) fray: stefan_schmidt yup
(1:23:14 PM) stefan_schmidt: ok
(1:23:23 PM) stefan_schmidt: 05) Status on layer splitting of metadata
(1:23:45 PM) Khem__: Hi
(1:23:56 PM) Jefro: question that has bugged me for a couple of weeks on 05
- why is it different from 02?
(1:24:01 PM) Jefro: (hi Khem__)
(1:24:09 PM) Khem__: Just sneaking in on an iPad
(1:24:18 PM) fray: originally it was seperate working being done both
related to 02 and the existing oe repository..
(1:24:27 PM) stefan_schmidt: Khem__: with OE on it of course ;)
(1:24:41 PM) fray: I've take it to mean (now that "02" oe-core is down) that
it refers to moving and modifying things from the existing OE repository..
(1:24:59 PM) stefan_schmidt: Jefro: 02 was more about general oe-core
problems
(1:25:06 PM) fray: -if- everyone is in agreement thats what it means, then
we should likely re-word the topic
(1:25:12 PM) fray: (or remove it if it's no longer an issue)
(1:25:20 PM) stefan_schmidt: Its just that some of the important problems
are actually around layers :)
(1:25:27 PM) RP__: Well, I think Koen's concerns fall under this
(1:25:32 PM) RP__: (topic)
(1:25:43 PM) RP__: but we can defer that to next week or the mailing list
(1:25:50 PM) Jefro: ok, thakns. I was just wondering whether 02 and 05 can
be merged at this point, particularly after RP announces oe-core to the
list, or whether they should stay separate. Now leaning toward the latter,
but will do what you guys want.
(1:25:55 PM) RP__: I'm not aware of any other issues
(1:26:00 PM) fray: yes.. I think we need to keep an open item about layer
"issues" brought up on the mailing list or elsewhere..
(1:26:16 PM) fray: (either content of the layer, way layer is being used,
etc..)
(1:26:28 PM) fray: RP__, I'm not aware of anything else yet..
(1:27:02 PM) RP__: For 6), I talked to the Linux Foundation today and I
think we might be obtaining some hardware in "weeks". Mike and Tom King are
dealing with that
(1:27:36 PM) stefan_schmidt: Good
(1:27:43 PM) stefan_schmidt: so Tom is already involved
(1:28:03 PM) RP__: yes
(1:28:11 PM) Khem__: is this hardware for general oe use
(1:28:25 PM) RP__: Khem__: It will be for OE to decide how best to use it,
yes
(1:28:33 PM) Khem__: Ok
(1:29:05 PM) stefan_schmidt: That leaves 07, 08 and 10 open
(1:29:18 PM) stefan_schmidt: elections now or as last item?
(1:29:19 PM) ***Khem__ thinks iPad is not that iBad
(1:29:27 PM) ***Jefro suggests elections as last item
(1:29:35 PM) Jefro: Khem__ is it iRad ?
(1:29:44 PM) stefan_schmidt: Khem__: well a fancy device just for IRC ;)
(1:29:46 PM) RP__: Well, elections is easy, we're waiting on the board
(1:29:56 PM) RP__: and its kind of related to 08
(1:29:59 PM) fray: AFAIK, the board is in control over that
(1:30:04 PM) RP__: right
(1:30:17 PM) RP__: So let me talk a little about this topic
(1:30:20 PM) stefan_schmidt: voting system tests went well it seems
(1:30:26 PM) RP__: agreed, yes
(1:30:35 PM) RP__: I'm not sure how many people saw the discussion I had
after the TSC meeting last week
(1:30:47 PM) ***stefan_schmidt not
(1:30:49 PM) RP__: I raised the issue of non-voting TSC members
(1:31:01 PM) stefan_schmidt: ah, you mean on the ml
(1:31:02 PM) RP__: It was shot down with good reason but I think it was
right to ask some questions
(1:31:09 PM) RP__: yes, on the ml
(1:31:29 PM) RP__: It made me realise how this TSC has operated very very
differently to previous TSCs
(1:31:53 PM) RP__: If you look at the agenda we're very focused on a
specific topic and we're functioning more like an interest group
(1:31:53 PM) Khem__: Yes
(1:32:11 PM) stefan_schmidt: hmm
(1:32:12 PM) fray: I'd certainly agree with that
(1:32:14 PM) RP__: The original idea of the TSC was a decision breaker, not
a discussion forum as we've been doing
(1:32:21 PM) Khem__: That was the mandate to start with
(1:32:22 PM) stefan_schmidt: you mean like an oe-core IG
(1:32:26 PM) RP__: yes
(1:32:42 PM) RP__: So my question is whether its time to rethink what we're
doing and where and how we're doing it
(1:32:45 PM) stefan_schmidt: thats because we have been setup for exatcly
this task
(1:32:53 PM) Khem__: I thing technical roadmap
(1:33:01 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: I know, but I think now is the time to
review it
(1:33:04 PM) Khem__: Is also what ya should be involved in
(1:33:20 PM) RP__: ya?
(1:33:25 PM) fray: The more I think about it.. the more I think an oe-core
IG makes sense..  I see the TSC as the group who sets direction -- and gets
things off the ground.. but eventually the work should migrate... (with the
e.V. and users taking over...)
(1:33:25 PM) Tartarus: So, I wouldn't object to making the TSC go back to
the old "decider" role, so long as we propose an open weekly IG type meeting
(1:33:27 PM) Khem__: Typo
(1:33:46 PM) Tartarus: Since yeah, it's really good to get as many of the
folks that care popping in, focusing on issues and otherwise being social
(1:33:55 PM) fray: Would the IG allow non e.V. to participate?
(1:33:58 PM) RP__: I think what this group has been doing it useful and I
don't want to change that
(1:34:15 PM) RP__: but I think a more open meeting and detactment from the
TSC might now be a good idea
(1:34:28 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: I think IGs should be based on technical
interest and merrits not on ev membership status
(1:34:50 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: thats only for stuff we need to vote on
because we failed to get it done without :)
(1:35:06 PM) Tartarus: Maybe I should correct myself, I don't mean IG in the
formal sense
(1:35:07 PM) RP__: So two questions, do we create an IG for this subject and
is it open?
(1:35:07 PM) Khem__: I think unless oe is released with. Oe-core we need to
keep functioning this way a bit as well
(1:35:17 PM) Tartarus: I just mean a time where folks that care and have
opinions can come in
(1:35:18 PM) fray: stefan_schmidt thats my thinking as well..
(1:35:25 PM) RP__: Tartarus: right
(1:35:25 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: Subject == oe-core?
(1:35:28 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: yes
(1:35:33 PM) Tartarus: And there's a set of topics and it's not a free for
all
(1:35:38 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: I would like to see this yes.
(1:35:53 PM) RP__: I think it would need an agenda and someone driving it,
maybe a TSC member
(1:35:53 PM) stefan_schmidt: Like there is kind of an IG for infrastructure
already
(1:36:02 PM) Khem__: Until next oe release we need to be working the way we
have a bit
(1:36:06 PM) stefan_schmidt: with people from OE and yocto
(1:36:10 PM) fray: the key for the success or failure of a switch to
oe-core, is that it needs to be actively maintained by a core of folks until
it has enough users (and maintainers) to continue to drive it..
(1:36:21 PM) fray: TSC fills that role today.. IG can easily do so tomorrow
(1:36:43 PM) RP__: The TSC needs to also covering what it used to be
covering
(1:37:00 PM) fray: yup
(1:37:04 PM) RP__: Er, The TSC needs to get back to also covering what it
used to be covering
(1:37:04 PM) Khem__: Besides yocto their are handful of folks using oe-core
though it's increasing
(1:37:27 PM) Khem__: Yes I agree
(1:38:20 PM) RP__: I put this on the agenda as I really want people to start
thinking about it
(1:38:34 PM) RP__: Perhaps we do so and come back to it next week?
(1:38:45 PM) stefan_schmidt: I was just about to propose this :)
(1:38:56 PM) fray: think thats a good idea
(1:38:57 PM) stefan_schmidt: I need to think more about it and a week would
help me with it
(1:39:03 PM) Khem__: I think we should have an item to discuss weekly
activity if anything needs discussion
(1:39:09 PM) ***RP__ tries to do longer term planning as well as short and
medium :)
(1:39:52 PM) stefan_schmidt: Khem__: hmm, we could gather some of the status
items under the weekly activity item
(1:40:12 PM) Khem__: Yes week in perspective
(1:40:58 PM) fray: ya, thats likely the right topic.. we can each mention
anything we know of thats happened in the last week or so..
(1:41:02 PM) ***Jefro jefro notes new perpetual agenda item
(1:41:11 PM) stefan_schmidt: Lets try if we can make such an item next week
(1:41:18 PM) Jefro: we can call it "weekly world news"
(1:41:52 PM) stefan_schmidt: for TSC and IGs people should think about it
this week
(1:42:28 PM) Khem__: Discussions on layering tools is important going
forward
(1:42:50 PM) RP__: There are people working on layer tooling
(1:43:04 PM) RP__: based on the f2f discussions we had along with mailing
list feedback
(1:43:13 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: will there be an interim status update?
(1:43:40 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: Would be good to have an early version
before to much works goes into it to give feedback and maybe direction
(1:43:46 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: Its being done in stages, I'd expect to
see patches at each step
(1:43:49 PM) stefan_schmidt: I guess you are directly involved?
(1:43:58 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: the plans are on the wiki
(1:44:04 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: ok, good. Is there a repo for it?
(1:44:08 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: please do comment on the mailing list if
you have feedback
(1:44:15 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: no, there is no code
(1:44:23 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: hence rfcs as soon as there is some code
(1:44:27 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: ok, so early still ;)
(1:44:31 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: yes
(1:44:39 PM) stefan_schmidt: nv then I wait for some patches :)
(1:44:39 PM) Khem__: Cool thx
(1:44:41 PM) RP__: stefan_schmidt: bluelightning is leading it btw
(1:44:48 PM) RP__: so talk to him if you want specifics
(1:44:57 PM) stefan_schmidt: thanks
(1:45:13 PM) stefan_schmidt: That means we only have 10 left
(1:45:19 PM) stefan_schmidt: 10) How should we (OE) handle non-Linux host
support?  Policies, priorities, etc.
(1:45:33 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: You have only Unix in mind or also
Windows systems?
(1:45:39 PM) fray: I bring this up because of the MacOS X work I did.. and
now a few other people have started in on..
(1:45:40 PM) ***RP__ commented on this on irc  which was that it depends how
hacky and invasive the patches are
(1:45:48 PM) Khem__: An IG will be good for it
(1:45:53 PM) stefan_schmidt: heh
(1:45:58 PM) fray: but it's not specifix to MacOS X.. it could easily be BSD
or even something like Windows (cygwin?)
(1:45:59 PM) stefan_schmidt: our first IG born  ;)
(1:46:06 PM) RP__: I'm fine with collecting up the changes and merging
anything that isn't going to be a major maintenance headache
(1:46:17 PM) RP__: please don't do windows
(1:46:18 PM) fray: what (as the TSC) do we expect for these?  what
limitations are made on this tupe of changes..
(1:46:25 PM) stefan_schmidt: but I agree with khem. Kergoroth and Koen did
also work for MacOSX
(1:46:27 PM) Tartarus: So long as it's clean
(1:46:29 PM) Tartarus: I don't think we care
(1:46:41 PM) RP__: It *needs* to be clean and not a maintenance headache
(1:46:41 PM) stefan_schmidt: and with other unix systems coming in the
patches should get less hacky as well
(1:46:42 PM) fray: my concern would be things like do we require filesystems
that are case sensative?  or will we accept changes to make case not an
issue..
(1:46:45 PM) Tartarus: And clean means the "ugly" hack for something in OSX
or Cygwin is isolated at least
(1:46:45 PM) fray: (just an example)
(1:47:20 PM) Tartarus: If it's all handled in conf/osx.conf and doesn't make
other things have 50 variables, it's fine
(1:47:22 PM) fray: thats the thing, I expect a few hacks here and there..
but what I'm not clear on is what will be acceptable.. (and perhaps the
answer is simply on a case-by-case basis we make that call)
(1:47:28 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: I think non case sensetive fs would be to
much of a hassle
(1:47:34 PM) RP__: fray: I think it has to be case by case
(1:47:53 PM) stefan_schmidt: its just to deep into all kind of packages ...
(1:47:59 PM) Khem__: Fray in general case sensitive ness sometimes is coming
from package arcs too e.g. Makefile makefile
(1:48:12 PM) RP__: and yes, a non case sensitive file system might be
potentially too nasty
(1:48:18 PM) fray: yup..  just mentioning it as an issue I know will come up
(1:48:31 PM) Tartarus: Khem__: OT, do you see my msg?
(1:49:21 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: gather some people around it, prepare a
contrib repo for the nasty stuff, think about cleaner solutions and bring
this forward piece by piece
(1:49:35 PM) fray: so anyway, I wasn't looking for a direct answer.. just
want to make sure when these issues pop up, as a TSC we can give direction..
and right now direction is not to overly burden maintenance on our core
Linux hosts -- and it needs to be "reasonable".. reasonable defined per
patch/change
(1:49:48 PM) fray: stefan_schmidt yup.. thats what I was thinking as well..
(1:49:54 PM) stefan_schmidt: Personally I think windows is not worth the
effort as vmare or such is easy enough for them
(1:50:14 PM) fray: stefan_schmidt agreed.. I think BSD and MacOS X are more
likely.. but....
(1:50:18 PM) RP__: and likely has better performance ;-)
(1:50:26 PM) stefan_schmidt: RP__: heh
(1:50:39 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: I think we can take them just as all
other patches
(1:50:57 PM) fray: (on a tangent, you'd be surprised at how many folks won't
allow vmware in their corporate environments.. and similarly won't allow
Linux because it's no a support OS..)
(1:51:01 PM) Khem__: I would be interested in bad
(1:51:06 PM) Khem__: Errr bad
(1:51:10 PM) Jefro: LOL
(1:51:14 PM) fray: (luckily thats changing.. but it's reality that may cause
someone to try to do native windows support..)
(1:51:16 PM) Khem__: Spell checker
(1:51:18 PM) fray: (that someone is NOT me)
(1:51:34 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: well, then he really will have a hard
time
(1:51:34 PM) Jefro: fray do you find that cygwin is similarly disallowed?
(1:52:01 PM) fray: Jefro, cygwin -- for the purposes of build system
emulation -- could be made to work, but is so incredibly painful, it's
unlike to be worth it..
(1:52:11 PM) stefan_schmidt: fray: I don't mind repos where patches for such
nasty things are shared, but those people should be aware that such things
can and will break quite often
(1:52:22 PM) fray: (I doubt significant changes to oe would be necessary to
support cygwin...)
(1:52:50 PM) Khem__: Yeah
(1:53:03 PM) Khem__: It's solaris or BSD
(1:53:06 PM) Khem__: Yay
(1:53:12 PM) fray: well hopefully solaris is dead.. ;)
(1:53:23 PM) fray: that just leaves BSD(s), and MacOS X
(1:53:23 PM) fray: ;)
(1:53:41 PM) fray: anyway, thats all I wanted..
(1:54:07 PM) Khem__: BSD and macs with ports might converge the changes
needed
(1:54:26 PM) stefan_schmidt: Khem__: and his BSD world around him in this
company building ;)
(1:54:58 PM) Khem__: Yes I might get nod on some work on it
(1:55:10 PM) stefan_schmidt: so we all agree that patches for this will by
case-by-case just as all other patches as well
(1:55:35 PM) Khem__: Yes
(1:55:44 PM) stefan_schmidt: we don't see urgent support for other systems
as linux but would welcome them if the patches are able to integrate it in a
sane manner
(1:55:47 PM) fray: seems reasonable to me
(1:56:32 PM) stefan_schmidt: good
(1:56:43 PM) stefan_schmidt: I think that's it for the meeting today then
(1:56:47 PM) Tartarus: Yes
(1:57:09 PM) Jefro: awesome
(1:57:12 PM) RP__: Can we minute that Koen has an action to read the
discussion on agenda item 08 in preparation for next week
