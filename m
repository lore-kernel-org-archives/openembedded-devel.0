I just went and looked at the code and as far as I can tell PRServ
defaults to always incrementing upon a change. To get the other
behaviour you'd need nohist=False to PRData() in lib/prserv/db.py and I
can't see where that is set other than to the default :/. I'm tired and
perhaps missing something though.
