FWIW assuming it works and isn't specially patched, I think for x11vnc we'd 
probably be better off using an external lib we can keep up-to-date rather than 
a bundled one that might be out-of-date; that is to say, if we are to keep 
x11vnc in OE-Core then we might as well also have libvncserver. (One might 
possibly ask if we really need x11vnc there though, I don't have an answer to 
that).
