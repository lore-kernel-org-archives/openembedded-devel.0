  one more (general) question about this ... there's a fair bit of
this task/packagegroup backward compatibility stuff under the meta-oe
layer as well. i assume that patches to the meta-oe layer should still
be posted to this list, but have a subject line of:

  [meta-oe][PATCH] ...

correct? as in, two separate patches.
