Doesn't the fact that the source doesn't build indicate missing support?

I don't know what C library you were building against, but glibc for mips doesn't contain a definition for struct user_regs{,_struct} in sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/mips/sys/user.h. It's a bit nasty, as the header very clearly states that user.h is purely for gdb, but pyflame is making use of it anyway. Patch 2/3 fixes the pyflame source for 32-bit ARM, where the struct has a different name, but at least it's present. I haven't investigated whether we could pull in the appropriate header from the kernel instead of libc, but again because ARM can be made to work with relatively little effort I hadn't bothered.

I could go down the path of working this out for mips, but fixing mips falls outside the scope of what I was doing at the time (I'm several yaks deep here), and given the problem is external to pyflame itself I'm not terribly motivated to fix it.

So I feel at this point it's either blacklist mips or we leave the recipe out of tree.

As an alternative to making mips work, can I assist with the associated maintenance hassle in some way?

Cheers,

Andrew
