I'm aware of the problem. The main issue is that we probably need to
start enforcing complete paths for all downloads in DL_DIR, including
http:// urls. This would resolve conflicts like:

SRC_URI = "http://server1.org/somefile.patch \
           http://server2.org/somefile.patch"

where the two files are different. The trouble is it will pretty much
break all the source mirrors :(.

Cheers,

Richard
