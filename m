This can easily be archived using different partitions like /opt as well.

Bandwidth is a big deal in areas that are not serviced by anything but very GPRS
or worse.  So 100 MB is even too big in some cases.  Cost is a factor as is
overall bandwidth.

Again, it depends on the product and what you are building if this matters.

The point is we don't want to make some assumptions that preclude alternative
implementations.
