No that isn't it. But also, no, that isn't broken. It works, but there is a
potential for a race, which is what we've been fixing.

Can you elaborate on why you'd declare that broken ?

For everyone. Richard wouldn't exactly take my series and kernel
updates if they were only just for me. :)

Sure. I've been at this for years now .. and I've seen and used lots
of configs. We are trying to give a choice on what level of building
triggers.

I rebuild the kernel a lot .. I'm doing kernel and kernel tools maintenance
after all :)

And I explained that I didn't need that explanation.

There's really no need to escalate your language. It isn't needed.

I'm checking out of the conversation, since I'm on vacation and shouldn't
be near a computer.

I indicated months ago that RP has the final say, and he can merge any
variants of the patches he wants, since they don't break anything and
fix the problem.

RP: I'll ack either patch that has been posted. I'll will revisit all of this
when I'm working on my 2.1 kernel packaging changes anyway, so
there's no need to wait.

Cheers,

Bruce
