Maybe giving us an impression whether it's correct or just work for =

Depends on your build machine and much more, your sstate cache,
changes to kernel and why you do a full build after each kernel
change instead of just deploying the kernel.

That's only build time. How often do you recompile your kernel that
this dependency really matters?

This is simply wrong, period. Because (I already explained that)
module-base.bbclass adds a configure-stage dependency to =
do_shared_workdir.

You can avoid the mistake by adding a sane stage for redo_shared_workdir
after do_compile_kernelmodules before do_strip and reassign the 3rd
party module bbclass to depend on redo_shared_workdir.

OTOH I think, build performance isn't worth a however sophisticated
fragile patch. Let's apply Stefan's patch and be my guest for sending
an performance optimized one when you figured it out.

@Richard - isn't it worth use the correct, even if slow, patch and
let Bruce anytime in not to distant future provide an optimized one
which can be settled and backported for 2.0.1?

Isn't release time soon enough?

@Stefan - would you agree to "addtask shared_workdir after =
do_compile_kernelmodules before do_strip"
instead of "addtask shared_workdir after do_compile_kernelmodules before =
do_install"?
