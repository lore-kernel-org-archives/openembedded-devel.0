We've discussed this on-and-off at OE developer meetings for a while no=
w. FWIW=20
I can remove them manually - actually I just got around to deleting met=
a-
picosam9 which has been unmaintained for years.

Part of the problem though is determining what "rotten" actually means.=
=20
Additionally, there's an element of leaving things around in case someo=
ne=20
comes to fork/revive them again. We do show a "last updated" date but i=
t would=20
be good to figure out some other way of determining and indicating "lay=
er=20
health" - to date I don't think we've managed to figure out anything pr=
actical=20
for that.

Cheers,
Paul
