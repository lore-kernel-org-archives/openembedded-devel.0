I agree; I think it is a valuable addition and worth having it as it
is indeed becoming more and more commonly used.

Besides, having it enabled in our autobuilders will also greatly
improve code quality as LLVM is sometimes more picky than GCC. In
Debian the exercise of rebuilding the whole archive using LLVM has
been very useful and has identified several code issues which has been
(or are in the process of being) fixed. Also to add on that, I think
the sooner it is done the better so we can solve issues early on the
release cycle.
