The thing is the Qt configure options are a little more complicated - many of 
them are three-state switches (enable built-in, enable as a plugin or 
disabled). Thus we've opted to split the configuration options into variables 
for each type. We don't get PACKAGECONFIG's DEPENDS handling, but if we used 
PACKAGECONFIG we'd lose some flexibility.
