Currently, uboot-sign.bbclass only supports to create Image Tree Source(ITS=
)
for "u-boot" and "flat_dt". However, users may want to support multiple ima=
ges
such as  ARM Trusted Firmware(ATF), Trusted Execution Environment(TEE) and
users private images for specific application and purpose.

To make this bbclass more flexible and support ATF and TEE, creates new
functions which are "uboot_fitimage_atf" and "uboot_fitimage_tee"
for ATF and TEE ITS file creation, respectively.

Add a variable "UBOOT_FIT_ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE" to
enable ATF ITS generation and it is disable by default.

Add a variable "UBOOT_FIT_TEE" to enable TEE ITS generation
and it is disable by default.
