Not planned, it has been talked about, particularly by the TSC members.

Well, its relatively simple to decide if an email is appropriate for
oe-core or not.

Sure we could start asking people to use tags/prefixes but I fail to see
the advantage of putting more email in one place when a reasonable and
logical separate exists which actively helps people.

For various reasons its not how I track patches for OE-Core.

We all try to find ways to make our workflows more efficient and to do
the best job we can at the things we attempt. The mailing list
separation actively helps me notice the most important things I need to
deal with. Now yes, I could use mail filters, I could do a variety of
things. Even with those I believe my response to various things would be
adversely impacted if we do merge the lists as with the best will in the
world, people sometimes don't do things like tags/prefixes/whatever and
its easier for anyone new to OE to get confused.

Cheers,
