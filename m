Sorry for not commenting on the origin patch, gmail buried it within
some other threads, but luckily this one popped up.

It is true that we've been carrying this for several years to deal with
the fact that the native sysroot is not searched by the pkg-config
called by mconf-cfg.sh (since it is separate from host and target
pkg-config).

As it turns out, in the past few weeks, we have come up with a way
to inject those native sysroot components into pkg-config without
the need for any changes to the scripts.

Scott: if you try again the the latest oe-core, and are still seeing
the problem with the mainline kernel, ping me, and we can see if
the pkg-config fix isn't holding for you, at that point, yes, we may
still need a hook like this to solve the problem.

Cheers,

Bruce
