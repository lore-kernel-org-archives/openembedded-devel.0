kernel.bbclass does not populate the rootfs, it populates the corresponding 
package. Any rootfs/initramfs is then built by installing necessary packages 
into it. Whether to install a package or not is determined by IMAGE_INSTALL 
and dependencies between the packages.

It is not an error, but a well-defined behavior. In the link below there's a 
comment about the default dependencies and how to alter them.

Basically, every kernel-module-* RDEPENDS on kernel-base, which normally 
RDEPENDS on kernel-image. So, when you insall a module into your rootfs, it 
follows the dependency chain properly. Hence all the suggestions you received 
to simply disconnect kernel-image from kernel-base.

That normally works for most cases, unless you need a mixed behavior that I 
mentioned. Hence, ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND trick.
