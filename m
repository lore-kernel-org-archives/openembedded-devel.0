Subject: Let me tell you how I really feel. Zero filter. If you need meta-python2, you need to become a maintainer. Immediately. Period.

I have absolutely no need for python2, I made this abundantly clear when I
created the meta-python2 layer.

If you depend upon continuing support of python2 via the meta-python2
layer, this is your call to arms.

I was originally intending to abdicate any support after the 3.1 "dunfell"
release, but managed to somehow continue supporting it into the crest of
the 3.2 "gatesgarth" release.

I will stop all support and actively refuse lo respond to any emails and
this layer will be dead and I have zero care in the world that it stops
being useful. I do not use it. I do not depend upon it. You are not paying
me to do this. You cannot pay me enough to do this. Period. Support
yourself.

If this is not clear enough, I am happy to have a virtual video call with
you that you will not like.
