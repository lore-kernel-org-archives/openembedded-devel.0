Usually it leads to more complicated partitioning and more complicated =
startup=20
(as well as update) procedure. Of course it can vary from system to sys=
tem,=20
but in my experience /usr merge was exactly the thing needed to clearly=
=20
separate and simplify things. One way or another you want to have your =
code=20
and users data to be separated, /usr merge makes it quite simple.

Sure.
