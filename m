OK thats why I am not seeing it on my qemux86 build.=20

this leaves us with only one problem - glibc/qemuarm issue

http://errors.yoctoproject.org/Errors/Details/8679/

I have seen this error with eglibc-2.19 and glibc 2.20 as well on x86 =
and arm as well in cases when using
toolchain from sstate and rebuilding glibc with that. I assume this =
could be  unrelated to glibc upgrade
and may be a latent problem. Could be missing dependency on a native =
tool or some such. I have been attributing it to gold
but that just might have been a red herring.

I will see if I can get to reproduce it.=
