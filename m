Yes, I had already previously suggested using Debian's syntax for the license 
field, which allows complex combinations, such as OR/AND:

Yes, I'm quite aware of Yocto/oe-core handling of licenses and checksum 
verification mechanism for them, but unfortunately we don't have that in 
mainline classic OE... We could try backporting it from oe-core to classic OE 
or just wait until with switch to oe-core completely. In that case I'd suggest 
avoid mangling license fields just to satisfy broken distribute_sources...
