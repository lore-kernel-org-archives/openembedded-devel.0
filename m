It seems that there are use cases beyond just embedded systems for
OpenEmbedded, so this logic is not really valid. See:

http://openxt.org/

And yes, I think it is useful for openembedded-core to have as broad an
audience as possible.

That said, what other layers use vala? If it leaves core, is there a
layer that can host it and support other layers using it without to much
trouble?
