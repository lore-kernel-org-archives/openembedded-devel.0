Agreed.

Well maybe clean it and keep the avr32 specific optimization?

It'd be good; in meanwhile we could move meta-oe version to OE-Core.

Agreed.

Agreed.

I think people using qte toolchain ought to comment on it.

Yes; I think I agree also because *most* people won't use these
backends so better to handle this in the specific
layers/distros/whatever needs it.

Dropping it would be a regression IMO so we might try to work in a
solution to OE-Core?
