I am targetting for 1.7 thats why call for wider testing to expedite.  but it could only be decided with some level of
testing. I havent done enough of testing yet myself it to be sure but in coming few days, it
will be lot clear

But if it turns into major issues then we can wait for 1.8 but it will
be quite an effort to keep up with these patches over a long period of time.
