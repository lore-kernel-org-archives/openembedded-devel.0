This is true; FWIW as the original author of that line in image.bbclass I
wouldn't object to changing it to ??= though.

Having said that, I would note that people are best advised not to try to set
too much from local.conf, especially when it's stuff that affects what is in the
final image. Anyone doing anything moderately custom should really have their
own distro config. FYI, we now have a section in the Yocto Project development
manual documenting this:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/dev-manual/dev-manual.html#creating-your-own-distribution

Cheers,
Paul
