Thanks Alex for the support. To get a better idea as to what the size
delta is I took the installed sizes from a rootfs logfile and the
total size for all modules (python2.7) is 6.5M python-misc is almost
2M of this and python-codecs contributing over 0.5M. The savings will
never be the full 6.5M as there will always be python-lang and some
other modules needed. There was a time where 32M restrictions existed
are some systems but are we really seeing devices with these
restrictions any more? what about exploring not shipping the pyc
files? I would much rather see this than imposing so much work and
churn for very little gain. Anyways, maybe this isn't the best forum
for this and it should be brought up to the architecture group.
