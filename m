khem

02) new topics

    - melo updates
melo VM has some issues where it was dying almost every day
per Tom its not hardware issue

then follow

03) action items from last week

  --> mention on list about features and stabilisation (RP)
done

      - elections
delay between elections? need info from board - duration between votes
--> TSC recommends 2 months to the board

      - oe-core
tom is beating up siteinfo and cursing perl
fray's multilib work against poky, but he also created a version against
oe-core+bitbake
--> RP to issue an RFC on fray's multilib stuff

      - bsp guidelines
Phil posted querries on linux-yocto which was discussed in detail
khem recommends a document on using tooling to extend linux-yocto to a
different machine and another doc to use linux-yocto tooling for a different
kernel sourcebase
consider having a 'normal' linux recipe in OE core that people can bbappend
Bruce volunteered
--> add status for next week

Paul Eggleton might be working on some OE wiki doc about OE-Core

     - metadata layer splitting
recipes are moving from meta-oe into oe-core somewhat smoothly
general idea is to find a way to split off sato, then rearrange the gnome
stuff on into e.g. gmae and gnome-proper and clean up spurious deps

     - infrastructure

Raw Transcript

(21:11:23) khem: Lets start
(21:11:37) RP__: fray is on vacation again
(21:11:40) Tartarus: no new agenda items here
(21:11:41) khem: we dont have scribe today so someone needs to send
transcripts [to Jefro]
(21:11:51) ***RP__ can do that
(21:11:53) koen: I'm about to fall asleep, so I'd appreciate if someone else
can chair
(21:12:05) khem: I can
(21:12:37) Tartarus: ok, khem chairs
(21:12:47) khem: any new items ?
(21:12:50) khem: for agenda
(21:12:57) koen: not from me
(21:13:12) khem: melo updates
(21:13:19) khem: I would like to add
(21:13:54) ***RP__ doesn't have additions
(21:14:39) khem: http://pastebin.com/xa37DyL5 here
(21:14:42) khem: agenda
(21:14:54) khem: I think melo will fall to infra
(21:15:09) khem: AIs from past
(21:15:11) RP__: "including Richard in case he wants to stop by"? :)
(21:16:32) ***RP__ guesses this is off an old agenda :)
(21:16:59) RP__: Last week I took an AR to mention on list about features
and stabilisation. I did that
(21:17:06) khem: yes it was I am on a console and weird things can happen
with links
(21:17:21) khem: OK we can close that AR
(21:17:50) khem: I sent email as well to request devs to post patches to new
layering structure
(21:17:56) khem: there were questions on that
(21:18:32) RP__: Did those questions get good answers?
(21:18:36) khem: no
(21:19:03) RP__: Is the problem someone just needs to write them down or is
there some unknown things which are the problem?
(21:19:07) Tartarus: There's still a need for oe-core for dummies on the oe
wiki
(21:19:17) khem: yeah as Tartarus said
(21:19:26) khem: people want step by step ramp up guide
(21:19:28) Tartarus: no offense, meant, for the log readers, nbtw
(21:19:34) Tartarus: I needed that post a while back myself :)
(21:20:09) koen: the oe-core and angstrom setupscripts might be to automated
for some people
(21:20:21) koen: (and even the 3 steps for the angstrom scripts are too much
for some)
(21:20:36) khem: I guess we need to reply to that thread
(21:21:09) khem: Moving on to Status
(21:21:32) Tartarus: Well, hang on
(21:21:36) RP__: I agree some further documentation would be good.
Unfortunately I'm maxed out atm and am not sure I can help there :(
(21:21:42) Tartarus: We need to write up "Use this script or that script or"
(21:21:44) Tartarus: and someone needs to do that
(21:22:05) khem: yes. I can take it further
(21:22:11) Tartarus: ok, thanks
(21:22:13) khem: and continue the thread
(21:22:34) khem: we will follow up on this next week.
(21:22:53) khem: Shall we move on to Status
(21:23:00) Tartarus: ok w/ me
(21:23:11) koen: the boards seemed to be confused about the elections
(21:23:13) koen: -s
(21:23:30) koen: so we can pick up the slack or wait
(21:23:34) RP__: thanks khem!
(21:23:41) khem: ok now RP is elected back does the second seat election got
announced
(21:24:02) RP__: Well, I guess the question is whether there is a delay
between the elections or not?
(21:24:24) khem: I guess we need to get this information from board
(21:25:08) RP__: Going back in time, I think we said a 6 month stable period
for the TSC was desireable so the interval was one month between
(21:25:18) khem: ok
(21:25:25) khem: which means August
(21:25:28) RP__: although at the last meeting we did talk about 2
(21:25:43) koen: but with proposal, discuss and vote it is nearly a month if
we do back to back
(21:26:13) Tartarus: I have no strong opinion either way
(21:26:29) RP__: koen: back to back it probably is then.
(21:26:29) koen: I have other things to do, so waiting is my choice
(21:26:39) khem: ok
(21:26:54) RP__: but I also don't have a really strong preference, I'm just
observing what's been previously discussed
(21:28:18) khem: do we need to recommend something to board in this regard ?
(21:28:28) koen: I think so
(21:28:36) koen: their minutes showed confusion
(21:29:33) koen: anyway
(21:29:34) khem: ok lets make it 2 months I guess that will be good for
completing the process
(21:29:36) koen: onto oe-core?
(21:30:15) khem: oe-core status it is
(21:30:38) Tartarus: Beating up siteinfo, cursing perl
(21:30:45) Tartarus: Hope to continue down the first path more, less the
second
(21:30:55) khem: I tried to make core-images work with uclibc
(21:31:01) RP__: We're getting there wit this...
(21:31:27) RP__: re: multilb, fray has done some work on writing nicer more
powerful tune files
(21:31:39) khem: cool
(21:31:41) RP__: The new versions look scary but should actually let people
do all the things they want to do
(21:31:55) RP__: I'm aiming to put out a RFC tomorrow
(21:32:03) khem: ok
(21:32:11) Tartarus: I've seen fray's work, concept seems fine
(21:32:27) RP__: I'll proactively merge the bitbake piece to try and make
this easier for people to play with since its a simple bitbake change
(21:32:49) RP__: means playing with version numbers again which I'm not so
happy about but I can't see a way around it
(21:33:09) koen: I'd like to reiterate my wish for merge requests/RFCs to be
against oe-core whenever possible
(21:33:59) Tartarus: I concurr but I know fray's stuff is vs poky
(21:34:00) khem: OK may be a message clarifying which patches go to which
list is needed
(21:34:09) Tartarus: And that was partly my point of the email I sent last
week we had little discussion about
(21:34:12) RP__: fray did make a version against oe-core +bitbake
(21:34:13) koen: since oe-core was very breakage free this week I had time
to test things
(21:34:30) koen: but since they were against poky I decided to work on
kernel 3.0rc
(21:34:48) RP__: koen: Its not that hard to apply them ;-)
(21:34:58) Tartarus: RP__: But it's not a git pull
(21:35:00) RP__: but I understand and am trying to avoid it where possible
(21:35:06) RP__: Tartarus: so?
(21:35:17) Tartarus: So our effort barriers have all changed
(21:35:34) Tartarus: "I've gotta export these patches some way to git am
them? Bah, I'll go work on something else that's calling my attention"
(21:35:54) RP__: Tartarus: just pull it into a branch and cherrypick
(21:35:55) koen: exactly
(21:36:02) ***RP__ has to do this all the time
(21:36:19) RP__: since nobody actually listens to any requests to make his
life any easier
(21:36:40) Tartarus: I'll see what the pain level is next time
(21:36:54) Tartarus: but frankly I assumed pulling poky-contrib into oe-core
would suck a bit
(21:37:01) Tartarus: So I just cloned a contrib tree
(21:37:15) RP__: Tartarus: doesn't actually matter. Means your repo has a
few extra refs in
(21:37:38) khem: I guess you get more testers if patches are already rebased
on oe-core
(21:38:01) RP__: khem: rebasing on oe-core isn't so easy when the series
touches bitbake+core+meta-yocto
(21:38:02) koen: the idea is that oe-core is the master repo, so patches
should be against that, whenever possible
(21:38:43) Tartarus: Maybe this is a + for submodule stuff?
(21:38:51) khem: so we will await next RFC on multilib
(21:38:55) Tartarus: And kergoth's make+submodule thing (and yes, I'm a bit
biased)
(21:39:00) RP__: Tartarus: I doubt that
(21:39:27) koen: I hate make
(21:39:35) koen: and I hate git submodules even more
(21:39:42) ***khem uses make+submodules in slugos
(21:39:50) Tartarus: heh
(21:40:01) Tartarus: So, moving on then, yes, we all await the next peek at
multilib
(21:40:01) khem: shall we move to next topic
(21:40:11) RP__: Bottom line is that the multilib stuff is hard enough to
develop without the branch problems. We're doing out best
(21:40:26) RP__: I'm really sorry its a pain to test and not a simple one
liner but I don't think its that big of an issue
(21:40:27) khem: agreed
(21:40:43) khem: BSP guidelines
(21:41:07) khem: Phil posted querries on linux-yocto which was discussed in
detail
(21:41:13) khem: would someone want to comment on that
(21:41:30) RP__: I read some of the thread, I saw Bruce repsonding and
haven't read the conclusion
(21:41:44) RP__: Is there something specific that needs commenting on?
(21:42:25) khem: I think a document on using tooling to extend linux-yocto
to a different machine and another doc to use linux-yocto tooling for a
different kernel sourcebase
(21:43:06) khem: I thoght it will be a nice addition to docs
(21:43:54) RP__: Was that mentioned in the thread or is this an extra
conclusion?
(21:44:02) RP__: Sorry not to be up to speed on that one :/
(21:44:05) khem: I guess that was conclusion
(21:44:27) RP__: ok, that sounds good to me
(21:44:33) koen: I think we need to consider having a 'normal' linux recipe
in OE core that people can bbappend
(21:44:37) RP__: Did anyone volunteer or do we need to find now?
(21:44:41) RP__: er, find one
(21:44:46) khem: I think Bruce did
(21:44:54) Tartarus: koen: Agreed, I thought we agreed to that a while ago.
(21:44:55) koen: bruce volunteered for large parts, if not all
(21:45:29) RP__: Lets add a status check on this to next week's agenda
(21:45:35) RP__: ^^^^ note for jefro
(21:45:36) khem: ok
(21:45:52) khem: so moving on ?
(21:45:56) RP__: btw, I think Paul Eggleton might be working on some OE wiki
doc about OE-Core
(21:46:20) khem: anything specific to layering metadata splitting
(21:46:24) ***RP__ will close on that with him tomorrow
(21:46:43) RP__: khem: I don't think it goes into specifics on that
(21:46:43) khem: thanks RP
(21:47:04) khem: RP__: I was mentioning the next topic on agenda :)
(21:47:06) RP__: khem: Just keep an eye open for it to avoid duplication
(21:47:17) RP__: khem: ah, yes ;-)
(21:48:00) khem: I have observed that recipes are moving from meta-oe into
oe-core smoothly
(21:48:21) RP__: near enough, yes :)
(21:49:04) khem: if there are no further comments on this then we can talk
about infra
(21:49:17) koen: people at work were kind of shocked when I told them new
recipes will have a tough time getting into oe-core
(21:49:23) koen: (new as in new PN, now new PV)
(21:49:35) khem: heh
(21:50:03) RP__: koen: well, this is where the layer model comes into play.
It depends what they do
(21:50:17) koen: RP__: that's what I said
(21:50:27) koen: but in general I think oe-core needs to shrink
(21:50:38) koen: I haven't come up with a workable plan, though
(21:51:04) RP__: koen: Personally, I suspect its actually about right -
enough there to actually test stuff but not so big its unmaintainable
(21:51:24) khem: I think if there are recipes that dont go into any core-*
image
(21:51:34) khem: that could move out to begin
(21:51:47) koen: I was thinking of splitting it up into more layers and then
move around a few layers between oe-core, meta-oe, yocto, etc
(21:52:11) koen: but like I said, no workable plan yet
(21:52:17) khem: ok
(21:52:32) RP__: It is a bit incestuous atm :/
(21:53:16) koen: the general idea is to find a way to split off sato, then
rearrange the gnome stuff on into e.g. gmae and gnome-proper and clean up
spurious deps
(21:53:43) khem: yeah I think just have x11 in oe-core
(21:53:44) RP__: I love the way sato is always the target for this :)
(21:53:59) koen: RP__: it's the gating item for various gnome portions
(21:54:17) ***khem will start about kde
(21:54:26) RP__: koen: Its also a good way to work out the core gnome pieces
(21:54:46) koen: RP__: see my comment about rearranging gnome stuff :)
(21:54:48) RP__: meta-gmae might be a better name for meta-gnome in core
(21:55:18) RP__: koen: I'm yet to be convinced we should remove all gnome
from the core
(21:55:20) koen: I'm not sure gmae still exists, but that's just splitting
hairs over the name :)
(21:55:40) RP__: koen: still exists, whether it actually does anything...
(21:55:44) koen: RP__: I'm not saying we should remove it, just that we
split it up, take a step back and then reshuffle
(21:55:55) koen: oe-core might end up being bigger, but better seperated
(21:56:17) RP__: moving it up a level in the tree might be better I guess
(21:56:25) RP__: its pieces like glib that get messy
(21:56:34) ***koen stops handwaving till he has a better thought out plan
(21:56:47) RP__: glib2 obviously
(21:57:00) RP__: koen: Also keep in mind timings
(21:57:16) RP__: If we do something like that it might need to be next
development cycle unless its soon
(21:57:26) koen: I know
(21:57:49) RP__: So we're nearly out of time - melo?
(21:58:21) RP__: I gather something happened but I'm unaware of what
(21:58:22) khem: someone popped here
(21:58:23) khem: sorry
(21:58:56) khem: melo VM has some issues where it was dying
(21:59:01) khem: almost everyday recently
(21:59:48) khem: per Tom its not hardware issue since other VMs are running
fine on same machine
(22:00:04) RP__: What is special about that VM?
(22:00:14) khem: nothing
(22:00:15) RP__: or is it broken software wise somehow?
(22:00:30) khem: yes it was installed long ago with ubuntu 8.04
(22:00:48) khem: and then upgraded to 10.04 but not reinstalled
(22:01:07) khem: so Tom decided that it was time to setup new
(22:01:11) koen: Tom K had a good description of the problem at ELC
(22:01:12) khem: instance
(22:01:53) RP__: ok, it sounds like Tom has a handle on it
(22:02:03) khem: and this vm has tinderbox and bugzilla and stuff installed
in weird way
(22:02:04) RP__: I have noticed there are some stale DNS entries around
(22:02:15) koen: the only issue today was that his mailinglist post got
delayed
(22:02:22) khem: thats because git got moved to different machine yesterday
(22:02:24) RP__: openembedded.net doesn't work properly now
(22:02:35) RP__: but I can guess why
(22:03:12) khem: over next week git will move to the final VM and other
services too will then follow
(22:03:35) RP__: khem: sounds good, thanks go to Tom for fixing this
(22:03:52) khem: and to cbrake and yours Truly here :)
(22:04:04) RP__: well, yes, everyone involved! :)
(22:04:20) ***RP__ wasn't sure exactly who was working on it
(22:04:49) khem: ok so we are done with agenda
(22:04:52) khem: thanks everyone
(22:05:13) khem: meeting is now closed
(22:05:17) RP__: thanks khem
(22:05:24) ***RP__ will mail jefro the logs
