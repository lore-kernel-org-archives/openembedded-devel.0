Indeed, I had thought of this... I think we could do a one-off hacked up parse 
to get the data into a separate table and then it would be more or less 
static. At least it would give us an easy way to report on recipes that 
haven't been migrated (currently I've been doing it with some scripts). 

FYI I've been doing some work in my spare time on the layer index code 
recently, implementing additional features and tidying a few things up 
(published in the paule/features branch). The barrier to getting this up on 
the live site is further testing and the database migration which I haven't 
been through yet other than locally; I guess the less migrations the better so 
it would probably be worth implementing the OE-Classic data structures before 
that happens. I'll take a look at this if I have some spare time over the next 
couple of weeks.

Cheers,
Paul
