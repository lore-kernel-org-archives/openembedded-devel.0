OK. I think the best course of action is to petition upstream for a stable 
release and then update OE-Core to that, then we can drop the recipe from 
meta-oe without ill effect.

So can you see a means for us to move this into OE-Core? Where are the points 
of conflict?

We kind of discussed this already - PACKAGECONFIG can't work for this  anyway 
because at least for the database drivers it's a tri-state switch. At the 
moment all these bbappends really do is set QT_SQL_DRIVER_FLAGS, DEPENDS and 
set the correct include directory. This is not a particularly advanced 
mechanism, is unlikely to change, and I don't think it's too much to ask for 
this to be set in each distro layer. This is distro policy and should not be 
expressed in meta-oe.

Cheers,
Paul
