The way I handled this was to make it so that all machines have the same 
MACHINE_ARCH, but MACHINE has some suffixes. This combines the kernels 
and such. Only problem with that approach is that OE will erase the 
kernel for a previous machine if you build for the next one, so you have 
to copy the resulting images to another location at the end of the build.

For your case, I think you can just use a single MACHINE. You can just 
supply multiple devicetrees, and I think the u-boot recipe recently 
learned to have multiple targets, so you can build multiple bootloaders 
for a single machine too.
