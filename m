To clarify, it's not that I have a custom patched kernel I need to use.
 I am following V4L2 development, so I am using a new kernel from those
developers.  V4L2 changes do of course move upstream.

OK, so here's what I'm realizing, please correct me if I'm wrong:
What I did unconventionally (ie. wrong) was to use a kernel version
newer than my linux-libc-headers were.  I should create a new
linux-libc-headers recipe, as I had done with the kernel recipe, and
build glibc and linux-libc-headers using my 2.6.38 kernel.

I only stumbled upon this because the gstreamer-ti recipes were pointing
at internal kernel headers, but because these are user-space apps, they
should actually be using the linux-libc-headers.  Right?

thanks for the discussion,
Michael
