I think in this case, it makes sense to backport a python first for the issue.

SSLv2 really isn't secure any longer.  Anything using cryptography should not be
using SSLv2, but if it available should be switching based on OpenSSL having (or
not) the necessary symbols.

For reference the CVE-2016-0800 change disables SSLv2 and various 'weak' SSLv3+
cryptographic functions.  This can be re-enabled, with a simple build switch in
OpenSSL -- but I'd caution against doing so.  Previous patches have mitigated a
related problem that would allow an attacker to get OpenSSL to downgrade to a
weak SSLv2 encryption, the 0800 patch takes it one further and just disables
SSLv2 completely.  So the previous fixes will help mitigate the problem, but
only disabling will remove potential reliance on less then secure methods.
