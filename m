Ok, so you only really have the options of:

a) Use a specific patched kernel for linux-libc-headers which has these
headers in it (see below for why this is ugly)
b) Install some extra headers in "libc-headers-extras" type recipe
c) Ship default versions of the headers with your userspace and use
those if shared versions don't exist. This assumes the API is stable and
on its way to mainline.

I don't think this is as common a requirement as you think as most
people get this kind of thing merged into the mainline kernel to try and
reduce this kind of problem.

The ugliness is where you have two different arm boards you want to
build, with a common optimisation/toolchain and each wants to redirect
linux-libc-headers to its own "special" version. The question is then,
why aren't the "special" bits in mainline.

Cheers,
