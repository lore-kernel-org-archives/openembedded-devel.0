Interesting - I hadn't seen that you're covering KDE in meta-qt5-extra.=
 Johan,=20
would you be OK with meta-kf5 being dropped in favour of what's in meta=
-qt5-
extra?

It seems Samuel has switched himself to "Inactive" - we probably need s=
ome=20
kind of alert when the last active maintainer of a layer does that. For=
 now=20
I've at least added a note to the entry. Samuel, do you have any opinio=
ns on=20
what we should do with the listing? Or anyone else?
