I've discussed this with RP on IRC, but haven't filled the bugzilla
ticket, my fault, will do that later.

What I'm trying to do is to prevent rebuilding them until the
underlaying problem is fixed (which can be tracked in bugzilla with 2
very simple recipes as reproducer).

I don't want this to show in every build and as "known-possitive" in
every sstate-diff-machine.sh call. It's less pain to just rebuild them
once per TUNE_PKGARCH even when they could be allarch.
