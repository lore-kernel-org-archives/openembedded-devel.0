This configuration can be supported by making a custom python3-modules 
package that whitelists precisely the needed files. But it shouldn't be 
imposed on everyone else - it's a significant burden to maintain the 
dependencies in every single python package, and keep the splitting 
working correctly in core python as well.

So I'd like to drop that - do keep in mind that very few people maintain 
oe-core (as opposed to sending occasional drive-by patches to fix 
specific issues raised in product development), and the headcount keeps 
getting smaller.
