For distros like Angstrom it is, yes, as I said above.

With PRINC gone would there be any other issue that would make removing layers 
a problem?

Can you help us to find out what's wrong with the PR server, assuming it's more 
than just PRINC-related? I suspect you'd need to be preserving the database 
prior to each build; maybe dumping the database into a file within buildhistory 
at the end would do the trick and then we'd have the repo revisions to go with 
that in the same place.

You didn't respond to this; I think this is the biggest issue we have. 
Contributors cannot be expected to just know the right way to do things unless 
you've made it easy for them to learn in the first place.

It's not just adding the banner but what the banner contains; in most cases 
the banner is going to be much shorter than the necessary explanation. In the 
most recent issue which we've been alluding to, the maintainer was very 
responsive when contacted directly and once they understood the nature of the 
problem, it was solved rapidly.
