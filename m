I'd say video content for FOSDEM should be around the level of the
things we'd show on the stand, short demos or introductions which can
be understood by people not too familiar with the details of the
project.

I'm going to record a short "Introducing OpenEmbedded" presentation
based around the way I usually pitch the project to folks who turn up
at our FOSDEM stand and ask what the project is about. I may also do a
quick build & boot demo with a Raspberry Pi if I have time to record
that.

Thanks,
