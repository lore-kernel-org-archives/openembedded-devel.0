  getting rid of all that "task-core" stuff in packagegroups looks
pretty easy, except for this snippet in
packagegroup-core-full-cmdline.bb:

    packages = d.getVar("PACKAGES", True).split()
    for pkg in packages:
        if pkg.endswith('-dev'):
            mapped = namemap.get(pkg[:-4], None)
            if mapped:
                mapped += '-dev'
        elif pkg.endswith('-dbg'):
            mapped = namemap.get(pkg[:-4], None)
            if mapped:
                mapped += '-dbg'
        else:
            mapped = namemap.get(pkg, None)

        if mapped:
            oldtaskname = mapped.replace("packagegroup-core", "task-core")
            mapstr = " %s %s" % (mapped, oldtaskname)
            d.appendVar("RPROVIDES_%s" % pkg, mapstr)
            d.appendVar("RREPLACES_%s" % pkg, mapstr)
            d.appendVar("RCONFLICTS_%s" % pkg, mapstr)
}

  would one simply delete that last "if mapped:" conditional in its
entirety? or what?
