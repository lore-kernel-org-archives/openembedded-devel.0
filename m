separatebuilddir.inc was really a stopgap solution to see how widespread
potential issues were. Ideally I'd like to get to the point where
recipes flag themselves are broken with out of tree builds rather than
having a list of ones which are compatible.

Doing this for OE-Core is straightforward now but what about meta-oe?

Would there be interest in trying to change that default or is it going
to be too painful?

This means I'm in favour of changing the cmake default if we can, it
looks like a simpler problem space than autotools.bbclass

Cheers,

Richard
