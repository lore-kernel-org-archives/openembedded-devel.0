Well, it's not like I specifically verify that all my patches get mentioned in 
the ChangeLog... :) But just glancing over it struck me that only u-boot 
related ones were listed:

Changelog for meta-texasinstruments:
Denys Dmytriyenko (3):
  u-boot-2011.10rc: update to cover ti33x SOC boards, not just beaglebone
  u-boot 2011.10rc: update with latest rev and new SRC_URI
  u-boot 2011.10rc: update to the latest revision

So, I checked the previous ChangeLog and couldn't find others from the same 
series, such as:
http://git.angstrom-distribution.org/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/meta-texasinstruments/commit/?id=2c8dcc2a8c16792c8a765a70109cc2462b83018e
http://git.angstrom-distribution.org/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/meta-texasinstruments/commit/?id=3b5eced12a10a3809f60df256b8f952c2286af4d
http://git.angstrom-distribution.org/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/meta-texasinstruments/commit/?id=98cca8ea1d324a1a59b7d96838952a579c72b419

While, of course, the commits in question are still there, your ChangeLogs 
provide additional informational benefits to the Community. So, I figured, you 
might want to fix that small issue in the script to make it even better... :)

No, I meant to add it to the distribution list, i.e. send future ChangeLogs 
also to meta-ti@yoctoproject.org mailing list, along with oe-core, oe-dev and 
angstrom lists. Unless you think it's overkill. Thanks.
