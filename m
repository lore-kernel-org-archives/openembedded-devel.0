I know we've had customers who want a 'busybox free' system.  In YP 2.0 there
were still a few items provided by busybox, so just disabling it (blacklist)
wasn't easy.

This sounds like a good opportunity to make sure that you can make a system that
works with and without busybox.

With that said, looking at [2] below.  I don't see that busybox ever really
supported or not systemd (contrary to what it says.)

It just means if systemd is selected, and the user is using busybox -- you
should not use syslogd out of busybox.  I think this is a reasonable requirement
-- and something that should be fairly easy to implement.  (With systemd, I'm
not sure why you would want to use the busybox syslogd anyway.. it's too limited
IMHO.)
