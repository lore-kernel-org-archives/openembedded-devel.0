Just the commit IDs from the top won't be very useful, because it's from
jansa/master branches which are rebased even more often than master-next.

If you really want to see them, then there are links to the build logs for
each MACHINE and you can see the build configuration there.

That's why at the bottom is the list of last master commit (as seen in
qemuarm build directory) and list of patches currently applied on top of
it. But to make it accurate for all MACHINEs I would either need to update
the branches only once in 2-3 days when the builds are all finished or to
repeat this section 3 times (which is sometimes quite long even when listed
just for qemuarm).

What I'll do is to include similar git log at the beginning of each build,
so if in doubt opening the individual logs will not only show the
configuration as seen by bitbake, but also the master branch and applied
patches.
