Are you discussing meta-oe alone here or all layers in meta-openembedded?

I've got a few ideas thinking slightly outside the box, so these may
or may not be workable:

- It might help to try to split the layers down further and reduce the
size of meta-oe (for example, create a meta-python layer for all the
python libraries that aren't direct dependencies of something
non-python in meta-oe) and then try get new maintainers for these
sub-layers so that the workload is spread better.

- We could create a new layer for unstable recipes which are 'use at
your own risk'. That may be a good place for recipes which don't work
on the jenkins builds but do work for some people and are in use (and
so probably don't belong in nonworking). This is similar to the
meta-broken or meta-nonworking layer idea but would take slightly more
recipes in.

- It may be worth taking some aggressive action in sync with the
upcoming oe-core release to get us to a green build, possibly by
throwing things into meta-nonworking and meta-unstable layers. That
may break a few people's builds, but the fix for them should just be
to add the meta-unstable layer. If they're building against the master
branch that should be tolerable and it won't affect anyone building
from a released/stable branch until the next oe-core release in 6
months time. Once we have a green build it'll be much easier to QA
patches and reject those which break the build.

I don't have much time to give to fixing this myself as I'm busy with
other projects. I do have idle computer time though so could run an
automated build regularly (probably just a script and a cron job
rather than buildbot/jenkins/etc). I won't be able to do a world build
for every layer for multiple machines, but I should be able to do some
subset. I may also be able to commandeer a spare server over the next
few weeks. Is there any particular config which would be beneficial to
build regularly?

Thanks,
