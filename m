> Hi all,
>
> I'm very happy to announce that we've finally been able to upgrade the la=
yer
> index at http://layers.openembedded.org to the latest revision on master,
> incorporating quite a bit of work that's been going on for the past few
> months. Improvements now visible:
>
> * Patch tracking - each recipe detail page now lists any patches being ap=
plied
> by the recipe along with upstream status for each - see attached screensh=
ot.
> You can click through to view/download the actual patch, and any URLs in =
the
> supplemental status text are also made into clickable links.
>
> * Source tracking - remote entries in SRC_URI are now listed on the recip=
e
> detail page and made into clickable links where possible - see attached
> screenshot
>
> * Link to inc files - there is now a link in the recipe detail page to an=
y inc
> files that a recipe includes as long as they are in the same directory, a=
s a
> shortcut to see the rest of the definitions for the recipe.
>
> * Recipe list CSV export - there is now an "Export CSV" button at the top=
 of
> the recipe list on the layer detail page. This currently includes the rec=
ipe
> name and version - we could look at extending this, but note that the RES=
T API
> provides access to all of the information programmatically and may be bet=
ter
> suited for many applications that need this data.
>
> * Site-wide notice support - admins can now add notifications to appear a=
t the
> top of the page across the entire site. This is useful in the case where =
there
> is some problem with the update process or maintenance is going on as hap=
pens
> from time to time.
>
> * Bootstrap 3 - the UI has been updated to use Bootstrap 3 from version 2=
 that
> we were using previously. This has made a fairly minor difference to the =
UI
> (padding/spacing/fonts have changed a little) but has allowed us to tidy =
up a
> few things in the code.
>
> * The "Base" layer type is no longer selectable for layer submissions. I
> noticed people sometimes selected this erroneously; it's only applicable =
for
> openembedded-core and meta-oe basically so that they show up at the top o=
f the
> layer list. Only admins can now select this type for a layer.
>
> * Numerous other bugfixes, robustness improvements and code cleanups.
>
> Thanks very much to everyone who has contributed to the layer index code =
up to
> now (and to BitBake / tinfoil, which we rely upon to extract the informat=
ion
> from the metadata), but I'd like to give particular thanks to Michael
> Halstead, Yi Zhao, Konrad Scherer, Robert Yang and An=C3=ADbal Lim=C3=B3n=
 for making
> this upgrade possible.
>
>
> Also integrated were the Recipe Reporting System (RRS) which powers
> http://recipes.yoctoproject.org and other distro comparison support, but =
these
> will take a bit more time to properly enable so I'll send out a separate =
email
> with further details when they are ready.
>
> As always, please let me know if you have any comments or notice any issu=
es.
> (I've already seen a few minor problems in the update logs so I'll be loo=
king
> into those.)
>
> Cheers,
> Paul

As daily user of layerindex I think particularly the first three
features are very helpful. Thanks a lot!
