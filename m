/etc was an example, the image should have the required files to make 
the target boot and the get the application configuration from this 
other partition. This is like openwrt does, it has a read-only rootfs 
and small read-write partition where the user can write its 
configuration and restore it at boot time.

If there is a power loss while the configuration is copied, the 
partition could go corrupt and would be difficult to recover. And as you 
mentioned  before the configuration files could be anywhere, so the 
script must be customized to get all those files and once the update is 
complete another script must restore those files, these could be 
cumbersome instead of the application have the config in another partition.
