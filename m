Thanks for doing this Khem, its quite some work and much appreciated!

Just to be clear, what is the intent here? Is it intended to get this
into 1.7 or is this 1.8 material at this point? We're effectively past
the toolchain freeze point for 1.7, just about at complete feature
freeze but I'd like to make sure we're thinking the same things.

I'm certainly happy to get this through the autobuilder and see what
happens...

Cheers,

Richard
