That's as up-to-date as it gets. There might be other forked repositories 
floating around, but that is the last official one.

No, as discussed on IRC, OE-Classic is now unmaintained. OE-Core and layers on 
top of it should ideally be used instead.

If you are determined to stay with OE-Classic I think you'd be better off just 
upgrading the recipes in OE-Classic - going backwards is going to be more 
painful.

Here's the only semi-related information we have, which is about migration in 
the other direction; it could be helpful in terms of providing pointers:
