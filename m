Sorry for the delay, I overlooked the last 2 replies because I was no

Isn't it the other way around?  Steffen Sledz had the opposite problem
as me in Feb
(http://www.mail-archive.com/openembedded-devel%40lists.openembedded.org/msg16022.html)
because he's using a kernel older than the linux-libc-headers.  He
quotes the kernel doc: "This means that a program built against a C
library using older kernel headers should run on a newer kernel"
