BB_GIT_CLONE_FOR_SRCREV will need to clone every git repository included
in metadata you're using (even if the recipe isn't built, because it
needs to define AUTOREV for parsing and that needs local clone).

empty BB_LOCALCOUNT_OVERRIDE should work correctly, but you need to
synchronize bb_persist_data.sqlite3 between multiple builders (if you
have multiple builders populating the same binary feed).
