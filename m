I didn't feel like I had good reason to object other than what had already 
been discussed. That should not be construed as me supporting the move. I now 
regret not commenting further at the time.

The problem is we now have a split between how shell function indentation is 
done in OE-Core and how it is done elsewhere, which as I'm sure you can 
understand is also a suboptimal situation.

We've been through this with OE-Core. We do do a significant number of 
backports and it has been painful when whitespace has changed. The TSC 
decision was taken in order to avoid this.

The problem with this is that you've effectively added pressure on Richard to 
change the the policy in OE-Core despite the explicit decision not to make 
this change there.

This kind of overall policy change *must* be done everywhere and not just in 
one place or even the majority of places. We shouldn't ever need to be in a 
position where OE-Core says you must do one thing and meta-oe and other layers 
say you must do the opposite.

Cheers,
Paul
