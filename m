I expect Richard will push back on this, and I would support him here.

So meta-yocto is right out. I'm a user of numpy, and I certainly do not
want to include something called meta-yocto-qa just to pick up numpy.

So this presents a quandry. Moving numpy to a special layer to support a
specific recipe is just not the right thing to do. Conceivably, we could
create a layer for the bits of meta-oe that are python related, but I am
not sure that solves your entire problem.

I certainly do not want to see one recipe appear in two layers. That is
a recipe for trouble.

Long term, we need to make the layer model work for the entire project
and get over the reluctance to use other peoples layers.
