Be aware that failures in this report are just small part of whole B!=3DS
issues. After setting B=3DS in them more issues were found in recipes
which were "hidden" before because of failing dependency in first run.

Now I'm in 3rd round of adding B=3DS and with ~180 recipes having this it
still fails in couple newly revealed ones - I'll send the list when it's
complete (and list of failing recipes is the same as last report before
B!=3DS or better)

It sounds terrible, but changing the default to B!=3DS was good thing, we
can easily work-around it by B=3DS/autotools-brokensep and we'll get the
advantages of it at least in recipes which aren't broken.
