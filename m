I meant to send it to oe-core, but I didn't check autocomplete. Anyway, =
seems I reached the people I wanted to reach :)

That would be nice.

Yes

True, but they'd have less plausible deniability :)

The funny thing is that I've run into bb(appends) trying to be social =
and breaking things, e.g.

linux-yocto.bbappend:

SRC_URI =3D "git://foo"
SRCREV_mymachine =3D "1849032784092359023"
ANOTHER_VAR_mymachine =3D "meta"

And that breaks parsing for every machine that isn't named "mymachine".=20=

Ideally all of them.
