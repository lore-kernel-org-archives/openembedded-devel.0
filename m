That's the right solution, although to do it really right (at least IMO=
) you=20
need to implement the /usr merge [1] (and that's orthogonal to using or=
 not=20
using systemd), which can also help you make your /usr read-only (becau=
se=20
that's just code and static data) with read-write / for user data of va=
rious=20
sorts.

And this is the approach I would recommend not doing. I've used UnionFS=
 for=20
thing like that (overlaying whole root file system) some 6 years ago, i=
t=20
sounded nice and it kinda worked, but it wasn't difficult to make it fa=
il=20
(just a little playing with power), we've even seen failures on product=
ion=20
devices, like when you have whiteout file for directory already written=
, but=20
don't have new files in it yet and that can completely ruin the system.=


Also, it usually works better when you don't have any changes in the lo=
wer=20
layer, but we're talking about updating it here, you can easily end up =
in a=20
situation where you have updated something in the rootfs but that was=20=

overriden by upper layer and thus your user doesn't see any change.

You probably don't need to separate 1 and 3, all the code for system up=
date=20
should easily fit into initramfs and just making /boot a bit larger wou=
ld=20
allow you to store some backup rootfs.

Also, you can swap 4 and 2 which will be useful if you're installing on=
=20
different sized storage devices, usually you know good enough the size =
of your=20
rootfs, but you probably want to leave more space for user data if ther=
e is an=20
opportunity to do so, that's just easier to do with data partition at t=
he end.
