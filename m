Thanks, Mark!

As I said before, I understand and agree with this CVE fix, especially in 
light of all the latest news... But backporting it all the way to fido seems 
to break bunch of older packages that still rely on SSLv2. Just saying that we 
now need to fix those either by patching or by upgrading, since past releases 
should not only be secure, but also stable :)
