It's nice to see this topic come up. For the last couple OEDEMs and OEDAMs I'm
usually the person to brings this up and it usually gets bandied about for a
while. There's certainly lots of interest in general and from the toaster
people in particular since old layers are likely to cause a build to fail
which leaves a bad impression on newbies.

Currently the best idea we've come up with is to have an opt-in class that
people can enable in their builds which will "phone home" to the layer index
indicating what was build (target, distro) which which layers. Hopefully we'll
think of a way of giving some sort of relevant status in the layer index;
maybe with different coloured balls (a la Jenkins) or something to click on
for the data. I.e. someone built a poky image for a raspi2 using master 2 days
ago and it succeeded, but the 3 people who tried since have all seen failures.
Maybe toaster could use this info somehow too.

Ideally, as a start, we would only record nodistro, core-image-minimal builds.
If people fed in their results with various branches and various (BSP) layers
doing this build in a month we'd have something meaningful.

We're open to any suggestions :-)
