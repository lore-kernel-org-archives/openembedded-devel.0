I can explain some bits on this one.

The main difference between xserver-nodm-init is not in this recipe
itself but in stuff it's using to get things done:
meta-oe version: xserver-common (includes settings for many MACHINEs),
integrates with xinput-calibrator

oe-core version: x11-common (uses formfactor to read MACHINE support,
xinput-calibrator not used and not available in oe-core

xinput-calibrator is now being reworked by Andreas so we should at least
wait for this rework to settle down, before it's imported to oe-core, some
people tried before, but not very well:

http://patches.openembedded.org/patch/13093/
http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2011-July/006814.html

My patches in first version of BIG xorg cleanup also touched xserver-nodm-i=
nit,=20
but because I haven't reworked x11-common/xserver-common at that time it was
correctly refused:
http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2011-September/01042=
1.html

In next versions like
http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2011-October/010814.=
html
I was cleaning only xserver, libx11, mesa and keeping
xserver-nodm-init/x*common untouched.

I still belive that moving root-less support to
x11-common/xserver-common is right way (user should be able to start
root-less Xserver from command line without using init script) and
/etc/X11/Xsession or formfactor should decide if MACHINE supports that
use-case or not.

xserver-common has a lot of local patches in meta-oe, but all we're sent
to Florian to apply them upstream and hopefully with new xserver-common
release.=20

I still find xserver-common a bit more flexible (I can do whatever I
want in MACHINE specific section of xserver-common script), but someone
can check what those specific sections are doing and add more possible
options to formfactor + more IFs to x11-common.

Machines with touchscreen were usually adding -nocursor (x11-common
should probably do the same with HAVE_TOUCHSCREEN=3D1 in formfactor), some
MACHINES were even modprobing kernel module (not sure if we want to
support this use case by formfactor), selecting different xserver
implementation is probably not so useful now with almost everything
using Xorg.

I agree that formfactor is easier to maintain and MACHINE specific
declarations there can be used by other stuff besides x11, so it's good
thing to have.

I don't have time to work on this myself soon, but if someone moves
root-less support from oe-core's xserver-nodm-init to x11-common +
formfactor. Then as first step we should be able to drop
xserver-nodm-init from meta-oe and use
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_xserver_common (already used in
packagegroup-core-x11.bb) to select between x11-common and
xserver-common.

And I think this first step should be done by someone with access to
device which is using root-less now =3D> not me and it's easier if that
person is not depending on meta-oe to get touchscreen calibration right
:).
