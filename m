Hello Chris,

do you think any of these pieces could be moved to 'official yocto',
specifically as bitbake-layers subcommands? I read through the README,
and it seems that things like 'status' and 'run' would fit very well
there.

Also note that there's a proposal for a json schema and layer tooling
that would be provided directly in oe-core:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky-contrib/log/?h=3Dakanavin/setup-layers

I can't help but say that there's a certain bit of irony in referring
to https://xkcd.com/1987/ - when introducing yet another external tool
for yocto layer management :-)

Alex

 It is still in relatively early development (in particular the =E2=80=98yb=
 sync=E2=80=99 command) but it is already helpful for my teams=E2=80=99 day=
-to-day work.
