yes that's right. However, I was taking this time to find out if we can drop all
the ones besides armv5te even if gcc supported it unless there were OE users
who are still interested in supporting them and had devices running OE
which need them

OK, that's a fair point, however, in OE's case I only have reports from users
with armv4t devices, but it we can keep the armv4 arm-only tunes around along
with the arm-thumb v4 ones
