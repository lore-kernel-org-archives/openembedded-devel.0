Hear hear!

Is anyone actually using tslib these days?  oe-core dropped kdrive,
and we don't package the apparently unmaintained input driver for
Xorg.  I guess a new upstream would be good, and then move to meta-oe.

I don't understand the full history either yet, but this is clearly
something that needs to be sorted.

When it's understood *what* that does, then we can evaluate it for oe-core.

Yes, half of it has been merged to master already. The rest should be
in Radu's branch, we can sort that today.

libav/gst-ffmpeg/gst-av (as it's called in gst1.0) has interesting
legal issues, but I do think it should be in oe-core.
