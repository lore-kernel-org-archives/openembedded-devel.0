Maintenance of uclibc seems to have moved to the uclibc-ng project:

  http://www.uclibc-ng.org/

Developers are active and they make regular releases. Buildroot
switched to uclibc-ng as the default uclibc a few months ago and it
seems to be working OK for them:

  http://git.buildroot.net/buildroot/commit/?id=3D68d4a3b5a6a6d03d67418e0b6=
37628ecf9cbf192
