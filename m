Hi,

I'm sorry you feel that way about it, I'll try to make it a bit better:

1) it was discussed and acked by major meta-openembedded contributors
and maintainers:
http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-devel/2013-April/044989.h=
tml

2) it was done just before we'll branch dylan, so that backporting issue
is only for people backporting over 2 releases (from after-dylan-master
to danny). And even if someone gets whitespace wrong in backport, then
there is no real harm, because as you say, it's only cosmetic now and
meta-openembedded layers were very inconsistent about it (tabs were used
only in minority of recipes).

Cheers,
