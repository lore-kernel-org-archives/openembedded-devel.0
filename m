I definitely understand this.... I wonder if the right answer is to create a
project for this either under the Yocto Project umbrella or just as a separate
project.. everything remains 'glibc' except for the kconfig chunk.

That -might- be able to relieve the burden from your shoulders.. but it wouldn't
be an overnight process.  (And if nobody actually cares, it might prove that
point and make it easier to justify removing.)
