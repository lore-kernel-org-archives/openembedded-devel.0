Hi,

Despite a good start this thread got rapidly hijacked, so let's try again!

Probably best to let Richard speak for himself here. :)

Right, so my point with the syncing was that this meta-yocto-qa layer
would be a copy of recipes from other places through combo-layer, and
would be clearly marked as such.

Reviewing the options:

1) Add python-mako, python-numpy, waffle and piglit to oe-core, for
all BSPs to use.
2) Add python-mako, python-numpy, waffle and piglit to meta-yocto
(effectively read-only clones with combo-layer, maintained in meta-oe
still) for Poky to use.
3) Add meta-python layer to Poky, and waffle/piglit to meta-yocto
(read-only clones) for Poky to use.

Paul raises a good point about other BSPs potentially using Piglit to
test their GL stacks.  Do any other BSPs test their GL integration,
and if so what tooling to they use?  I'm only pushing for Piglit
because it's what the Intel driver team use to test Mesa, but if
nobody else wants to use it then that's an argument for keeping it in
Poky (or even cloning it into meta-intel?).
