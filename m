basically all of the layers which are included in my world builds, so it
includes all layers in meta-openembedded, most from meta-smartphone,
meta-browser, meta-qt5..

Agreed I would be happy to accept patches creating meta-python layer,
ideally sent by someone who will volunteer to maintain it.

The difference between meta-broken and meta-unstable from my POV is
that, "broken" should be just temporary place and someone should
eventually fix it, but if we move stuff to meta-unstable and stop
testing it, then I fear that it will became just junkyard.

If some recipe works fine for someone when building for arm, but
triggers "jenkins/world" build issues for x86* then lets restrict it
only for arm with comment which shows the error - that's better than
moving it to "broken" or "unstable".

you mean being aggressive before or after creating the "next-release"
branch? I would prefer to be aggressive before to have green builds in
release branch.

Doing "big" builds in different setups is of course useful, but right
now I think we already have "more logs than what we're processing".

So I think that building not whole world, but those recipes which are
regularly failing would be good start, if people cannot reproduce some
issues which are shown in my jenkins builds we should compare the builds
and narrow possible reasons (e.g. failing only with dash, failing only
with some PACKAGECONFIG enabled or disabled).

I'm trying to stay close to distroless config, but some tweaks are
needed in order to have bigger test coverage (e.g. enabling some
PACKAGECONFIGs which are disabled by default, but something requires
them, or changing P_V to newer again because something else needs it,
enabling gold, because it's more strict so it can catch more issues..)

Jenkins builds are running almost non-stop (because it usually takes
around 24 hours per architecture), so often when I want to debug the
issue directly on that server in WORKDIR where it failed it's already
gone from tmpfs and the workspace is already "blocked" by next build.
