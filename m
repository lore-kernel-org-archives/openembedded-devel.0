I think the conclusion we've come to is let's not have inc files just for the 
sake of having them; if we need to add them to share common functionality we 
will, but as time goes on it may be appropriate to factor some of them out. 
(Having said that I think it would cause more harm than good to go on a huge 
spree and merge a load of them away, at least at this point.)

Cheers,
