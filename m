I tested your libtool patch in master-next with the bzip2 recipe.=C2=A0 I=
t
works as intended; libbz2.so.1.0.6 and all the other output files are
now reproducible with LTO enabled.=C2=A0 I also verified that libtool is
passing the -f*-prefix-map flags to the link command in log.do_compile
as intended.

I also verified that core-image-minimal builds successfully with the
libtool patch.
