Problem with mozjs are

* some packages ask for certain versions of mozjs. That's why distros
have multiple versions.
* if I am not mistaken version 68 of mozjs asks for rust/cargo which
is (not yet) in a common layer

Am working on python3 port. Current situation: Configure is almost
done but after

| updating cache ./config.cache

I see no progress in log file / 100% on one CPU / memory is eaten up.
Had a similar situation in earlier stages but fixed that by endless
debug sessions and removing parts suggested in [1]

Long story short: Haven't lost hope to come up with a working python3
port but I cannot promise if I get there and when.
