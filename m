It would be nice to change it in smaller steps, e.g. by bbclasses.

I'm already using separate B by default in meta-qt5 and it works good.

Adding it in cmake, qmake4, then autotools.bbclass, then ... would allow
to fix meta-oe recipes in smaller chunks instead of trying to fix them
all at once. And if we change it only for few .bbclasses then it would
still be improvement.
