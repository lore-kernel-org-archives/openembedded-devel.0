One thing we didn't discuss in that thread but which might help would be
whitelisting update-rc.d as a dependency? If that is the cause of many
of the problems, that would help. In this case it does look like the
weston RDEPENDS is the problem and  and the ABISAFE variable is the
better way to fix it though.
