I agree, currently we have the option to use core-image-{full-cmdline,
lsb} that don't come with busybox but comes with standard linux
utilities may me not targeted for embedded systems. Will be good if we
could provide support for toybox or another busybox like implementation
of shell, tools.

The support was very basic for enable busybox-syslog start/stop with
systemd.

Yes that's an option to mantain to get rid of busybox-syslog and only
use systemd journald.
