Adding Ross, Richard and Steve.

I'm wondering if it makes sense to consider .diff.gz (or .patch.gz) files
as patches for
cve-check. They basically come directly from 3rd parties and it is quite
unlikely to expect
them to keep the CVE: tag. All the pieces of documentation I can find
mention also only
.patch files for CVEs, and not .patch.gz.

This is tempting to remove the .gz handling here (for the cve-check) in my
opinion.

Also, since the commit f5f97d33a1703d75b9fd9760f2c7767081538e00, cve-check
depends only on do_fetch.

Any further opinions?

Regards,
Marta
