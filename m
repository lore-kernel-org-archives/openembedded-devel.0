I don't think there's that much of a division. I don't recall if it was you 
that raised it at the time but the issue of having two style guides did get 
rectified - I changed the one on the Yocto Project wiki to simply be a link to 
the OE style guide in June last year. It certainly didn't come about through a 
conscious decision to have a different style.

However there is a minor disagreement over indentation for shell functions 
between OE-Core and other layers - this persists because of the backporting 
pain a blanket replacement would potentially lead to. As I recall this did get 
discussed at the OE TSC level. I think that's one thing we could just not 
evaluate (or make an option) until such time as we resolve the difference - and 
I do mean to see it resolved at some point in the future.

Perhaps yes; I'm a bit concerned that list still doesn't have that many 
subscribers though (currently 28, two of which are the same person).

Cheers,
