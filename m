To put the other side of the argument to this, if you leave things and
just update once, you bring in more change and it usually ends up being
progressively harder to debug any issues since more things changed and
you don't know which change caused which problem.

OE-Core has there fore gone for the "update regularly" philospohy where
we can. This means we get to know about issues earlier and have more
time to fix them, they're also less likely to get confused with other
bugs.

I'd disagree :)

At least for OE-Core, there is a strong pressure to try and keep up to
date. The stability is found in the release branches one a set of
versions are locked in.

If we run into problems and talk to upstreams, the invariable question
was "does this reproduce with the last release (or head of SCM)?". If
we're up to date, it makes it easier for us to talk to upstreams in that
regard too.

Cheers,
