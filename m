I didn't go so far to say uClibc is dead, it is just totally unclear
when the next release is planned.

Dunno, time will show.

I think most embedded projects try to push their local patches to
upstream. At least buildroot does it a lot and I try to do it if
time permits. In your example the uClibc maintainer could also just
add the patch and mention where he has got it from. Or should the
known bug should just be ignored, because of a missing S-o-b?

A good mantra: Release early, release often.
I have no plans doing regular releases every static time period.
Just if it make sense.

Trac has it included:
http://www.uclibc-ng.org/browser/uClibc-ng
Or:
http://www.openadk.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=uClibc-ng.git;a=summary

No. Just me. I am using it for my OpenADK project. I published the
stuff so others might benefit from it. Some buildroot and OpenWrt
devs were interested.

Yes. I wanted to inform the freetz project, but I didn't find a
mailinglist or the mail adresses of the main contributors.
Most of the patches are either backports from git master or from
OpenWrt. I hope the rest might get contributed by the freetz people
with some meta-information, what kind of problem is fixed by a
patch.

best regards
