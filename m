It looks like the ruby problem is being caused by MJIT_DLDFLAGS in
build/tmp/work/core2-64-poky-linux/ruby/3.0.2-r0/build/mjit_config.h.=C2=A0
There is already a patch
poky/meta/recipes-devtools/ruby/ruby/0001-template-Makefile.in-do-not-wri=
te-host-cross-cc-item.patch
that removes some of these items for the sake of reproducibiltiy.=C2=A0 B=
ut I
do not know ruby, so I do not know the implications of doing the same
thing for MJIT_DLDFLAGS.
