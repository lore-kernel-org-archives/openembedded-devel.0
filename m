Did you report this? FWIW it's the first I recall hearing of the problem; 
perhaps I just missed it.

As I said last time, I'm not arguing that rebuilding allarch recipes on 
machine change is preferable - obviously it isn't. On the other hand, what 
you're doing with this kind of change is telling the build system that the 
recipe needs to be built differently depending on what the target architecture 
is, which is *not* true; this is only being done to work around the build 
system making an assumption that the rebuild needs to happen. Fix the 
assumption and the problem is fixed, properly. 

If we need to make changes to the core or BitBake to make it easier to handle 
this properly, by all means let's do that; but if we go down the road of 
applying the workaround to every recipe where we hit this issue (and as we 
have seen it's not just one or two recipes) we will never get around to fixing 
the underlying problem.

Cheers,
Paul
