well no. I was pointing to that fix as to what inspired what I'm working
on, not as 'the fix'. In that thread itself, we comment that it was a race
condition .. so that has been clear for a while. That doesn't make it
broken, it makes it incomplete :)

Even in the first threads on this, I didn't disagree that this fixes the
problem. I'm (and Richard) are the ones that will get the complaints
if someone has a performance issue, or their build is otherwise
changed .. hence the hesitation.

Indeed. Don't take my prolonging of this discussion as anything but me trying
to make sure that any changes are thorough and not breaking workflows.
Raising the bar (even if only a little bit) is what we try to do :)

.. now I'm REALLY going to put down my keyboard .... hopefully ;)
