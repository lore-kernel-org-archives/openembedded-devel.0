I don't think that would be possible anyway. The Yocto Project itself does not 
officially maintain support for the contents of that repository. It's true that 
I'm maintaining meta-webserver and folks at Wind River are maintaining meta-
networking and some other bits and pieces, but AIUI that work isn't officially 
under the Yocto Project umbrella - e.g. we do not run these through our QA / 
testing / release processes like we do Poky / OE-Core.

FWIW, I didn't yet mention my suggestion - I was thinking about meta-oe (the 
layer) being renamed to "meta-misc" in the absence of some better suggestion. 
I'm sure we could have a transition mechanism via a specialised layer.conf 
where the old name continues to work for a limited time.

Yes, that should definitely be changed as well. They're supposed to be mirrors 
so they should have the exact same names, IMHO.
