Not suggesting another layer, but rather some layout/ordering changes.

1) Could the mail start by an ordered list of what repos/layers are
covered? Something like:
openembedded-core
meta-openembedded
meta-angstrom
meta-texasinstruments
openembedded

2) I think that quite a few (especially distro developers, no matter
if it is public or in-house distros) would appreciate having the
changelog in the order of the more "low-level" first. I.e. most people
will be using oe-core and meta-oe, thus start with them. For the rest,
I'm not sure, either sort by popularity or in a strictly alphabetical
ordering. E.g.:
Changelog for openembedded-core:
Changelog for meta-openembedded:
Changelog for meta-angstrom:
Changelog for meta-texasinstruments:
Changelog for openembedded:

I think that this will increase the visibility of the lower level changes.

Regards,
Anders
