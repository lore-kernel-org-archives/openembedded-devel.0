its a lot of work and upstream is not so keen on supporting it either,
so even if we spend time to clean it up
and send upstream it might need dedicated maintenance which is going
to be quite frequent breakages
since no one will test all kconfig combos. At this point this is the
biggest drag to take glibc forward I spend lot of time on keeping
these
patches moving forward. so we want
to avoid needless effort if there is so little userbase for it. Cross
localedef and others we still will keep.
