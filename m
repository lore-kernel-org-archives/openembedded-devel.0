With the fixes I've sent in last few days we're almost clean again (at
least for the recipes I was testing in this run).

Only issue is samba->libpam and yocto-linux failing to build.

Complete log qemuarm:

Complete log qemux86:

qemuarm:
ERROR: 2 issues were found in these recipes: samba vlc
WARN: vlc: vlc rdepends on libvorbis, but it isn't a build dependency?
WARN: samba: samba rdepends on libpam, but it isn't a build dependency?

I've fixes PATCHv2 for vlc, so qemux86 is even better:
ERROR: 4 issues were found in these recipes: cifs-utils linux-yocto linux-y=
octo-tiny-kexecboot samba
WARN: samba: samba rdepends on libpam, but it isn't a build dependency?

cifs-utils is there only because of linux-yocto

I'll merge pending meta-oe patches soon (tonight) into master as well as je=
thro branches.
Lets hope that pending oe-core patches get merged before next (2.1) release!
