Raw Transcript

(12:59:30 PM) Tartarus: roll call?
(12:59:34 PM) Jefro: is it just me, or does this channel now log activity
for a day or so?
(12:59:35 PM) koen: aye
(12:59:59 PM) Jefro: I see fray khem koen RP__ Tartarus - a quorum.  is
stefan still out?
(1:00:13 PM) fray: I'm here this minute, but I have to leave...
(1:00:32 PM) fray: I'll stick around as long as I can...
(1:01:07 PM) khem: I am here
(1:01:16 PM) Jefro: fray ok - I think that still leaves 4
(1:01:29 PM) ***RP__ is here
(1:01:55 PM) Tartarus: yeah, at least 4, did stefan say anything before
hand??
(1:02:27 PM) Jefro: not to me
(1:02:46 PM) ***RP__ doesn't remember anything
(1:02:55 PM) Tartarus: Give him 'till 5 past?
(1:03:19 PM) Tartarus: do we have an agenda up yet?
(1:03:21 PM) Jefro: ok.  fray, any burning issues you need to discuss before
you go?
(1:03:26 PM) Jefro: Tartarus I was just building one
(1:03:51 PM) ***Jefro 's week has been plagued with hardware issues, both
computer and human
(1:03:51 PM) fray: Just that I havn't gotten to the final rev of the commit
guidelines yet..  I won't be able to get to that until the morning
(1:03:59 PM) fray: (but I finally cleared everything else off my schedule)
(1:04:10 PM) RP__: fray: lucky you :)
(1:04:17 PM) Jefro: fray I was going to get together with you for some
guidelines of some kind...
(1:04:56 PM) fray: yes we still need to do that..
(1:05:08 PM) fray: Most of my day tomorrow is open, except around noon..
(well as of right now)
(1:05:23 PM) Jefro: fray cool, I'll try to contact you relatively early
given the time dif
(1:05:51 PM) Jefro: anyone have a problem following the same agenda as last
time?
(1:05:56 PM) Jefro: meeting chair is #1
(1:06:37 PM) fray: ok, I've got to go.. sorry.
(1:06:47 PM) Jefro: fray seeya
(1:06:48 PM) Tartarus: Jefro, didn't we talk about letting you chair last
week?
(1:06:51 PM) Tartarus: or am I crazy?
(1:06:54 PM) koen: didn't we volunteer Jefro ?
(1:07:00 PM) ***RP__ volunteers this week
(1:07:02 PM) Jefro: Tartarus you may be crazy.. :)  I thought that was for
last week
(1:07:08 PM) Jefro: http://pastebin.com/JADncdCV is last week's agenda.  any
modifications or additions?
(1:07:08 PM) RP__: jefro did last week I think
(1:07:35 PM) koen: tom k ask for an hw IG
(1:08:07 PM) RP__: ok, I'll chair
(1:08:11 PM) Tartarus: s/hw/infrastructure/
(1:08:17 PM) RP__: agenda looks good apart from listing things we've closed
on
(1:08:30 PM) ***Jefro notes RP__  as chair
(1:08:47 PM) RP__: Koen wants to add the hw IG to the agenda
(1:08:53 PM) RP__: anything else for 03?
(1:08:56 PM) RP__: we 02?
(1:08:59 PM) RP__: er, 02
(1:09:26 PM) Tartarus: not here
(1:09:33 PM) koen: yeah, mailinglist police
(1:09:44 PM) koen: e.g. stop people from posting oe-core stuff to poky only
(1:10:00 PM) RP__: koen: Yocto folks are working on that
(1:10:37 PM) ***Jefro notes infrastructure SIG discussion topic
(1:10:37 PM) RP__: koen: Most have got the message but those who haven't are
getting reminded
(1:10:47 PM) khem: and sometimes cross posting too much
(1:10:57 PM) khem: patches in particular
(1:11:00 PM) RP__: khem: emails have been sent about that too
(1:11:20 PM) Jefro: does that cover the mailinglist police topic?
(1:11:35 PM) RP__: I will sent out a reminder to the yocto people. I think
that covers it unless anyone has anything else to add?
(1:11:43 PM) khem: oe-core does not allow attaching patches
(1:11:47 PM) khem: is that intentional
(1:11:52 PM) RP__: khem: no
(1:12:18 PM) RP__: koen: any idea why its doing that (as our mailman admin
;-)) ?
(1:12:21 PM) khem: so if I compose email and add patch as attachment it
strips out the patch and sends the bare message
(1:12:33 PM) khem: more than 1 person has seen this problem
(1:12:39 PM) koen: either the mime type is messed up or the attachment is
too large
(1:12:55 PM) khem: no patches are 1-2 liners
(1:13:13 PM) khem: and patch can be generated by git diff
(1:13:21 PM) khem: it strips it
(1:13:44 PM) koen: the cases I've seen is where the mime type is messed up
(1:14:17 PM) koen: since I'm not fluent in mailman, can't we just tell
people to not attach patches?
(1:14:18 PM) khem: for me same mutt sends it fine to oe-devel same is
stripped by oe-core AFAICT
(1:15:08 PM) khem: koen: http://support.tigertech.net/mailman-attachments
(1:16:44 PM) Jefro: sorry to interrupt - is this an education issue ("send
patches to patches list instead of oe-core") or a mailman issue ("enable
oe-core ml to handle patches") ?
(1:17:00 PM) RP__: I think we need to fix mailman
(1:17:05 PM) RP__: there is likely a config error
(1:17:17 PM) RP__: koen: If you can't find it, let me know the password and
I'll take a look
(1:17:27 PM) RP__: So, 03)
(1:17:39 PM) RP__: GNOME discussion still needs to happen on the mailing
list IMO
(1:17:51 PM) Tartarus: Agree
(1:18:05 PM) Tartarus: Anyone in the room now that needs a poke to reply or
start a discussion?
(1:18:16 PM) Tartarus: If so, consider yourself poked
(1:18:45 PM) Jefro: Stefan had the action item 2 weeks ago, last week
Tartarus said he would do it if it didn't happen
(1:18:56 PM) Tartarus: That was re 2011.06
(1:18:58 PM) Tartarus: stefan started
(1:19:02 PM) RP__: ok, cool
(1:19:04 PM) Jefro: ah - sorry
(1:19:08 PM) RP__: and the bitbake list migrated
(1:19:11 PM) Tartarus: I read, and haven't said anything since no one else
has said yes, we need it
(1:19:25 PM) Tartarus: So, lets see
(1:19:26 PM) Jefro: no one has volunteered to start a GNOME discussion yet
(1:19:32 PM) RP__: ok, I think we can consider that issue closed then
(1:19:37 PM) Tartarus: That was the 30th
(1:19:41 PM) Tartarus: give folks the rest of the week
(1:19:48 PM) Jefro: RP__ closed bitbake issue
(1:19:50 PM) Tartarus: And if no one pops up saying no, we must have another
oe.dev release
(1:19:55 PM) Tartarus: close it
(1:20:02 PM) RP__: agreed
(1:20:09 PM) Tartarus: koen, don't you have a stake in GNOME stuff?
(1:20:15 PM) Jefro: Tartarus sounds good - decide next week re 2011.06?
(1:20:17 PM) koen: yes
(1:20:27 PM) koen: I get hassled at work now to add gnome stuff
(1:20:29 PM) Tartarus: koen: Can you start the GNOME discussion off?
(1:20:36 PM) koen: but I get hassled more for other things
(1:20:40 PM) Tartarus: Ha
(1:20:58 PM) RP__: personally, I think a core in oe-core makes sense and all
the other bits in a later component of meta-oe or a separate repo, I don't
mind which
(1:21:09 PM) RP__: (for gnome)
(1:21:16 PM) RP__: but I will say as much on the mailing list
(1:21:38 PM) RP__: For 04, the members elections should be done now and
we're waiting on the result, then the TSC elections should happen
(1:21:59 PM) RP__: Last week we talked about someone volunteering to step
out the TSC. Did we close on that?
(1:22:21 PM) Jefro: no closure that I saw
(1:22:22 PM) ***Jefro sent out the minutes about 1/2 hr ago
(1:22:53 PM) RP__: Ok, let me volunteer to stand down at the first election
(1:23:02 PM) Jefro: stefan mentioned something about it two or three weeks
ago as I recall
(1:23:23 PM) RP__: stefan isn't here so that doesn't help us
(1:23:49 PM) Jefro: true - fray is gone as well. I suggest deferring that
discussion to next week, and requiring all TSC members to attend.
(1:23:52 PM) Tartarus: RP__, I think none of us want you to stand down,
given your position in oe-core
(1:24:01 PM) ***Jefro thought RP was joking
(1:24:13 PM) RP__: Tartarus: doesn't matter really, I have to stand for
election at some point
(1:24:25 PM) koen: we can just reelect him
(1:24:29 PM) RP__: Jefro: I'm serious
(1:24:46 PM) ***RP__ hopes he might get reelected, if I don't I stop having
to attend these meetings
(1:24:52 PM) RP__: :)
(1:25:48 PM) Tartarus: So, in sum, we need a TSC meeting where everyone
attends, asap
(1:25:57 PM) RP__: I don't think it matters
(1:25:57 PM) Tartarus: Or a off-the-ML thread?
(1:26:09 PM) RP__: I can go first and then we can worry about the rest at a
later meeting
(1:26:19 PM) Tartarus: Er
(1:26:30 PM) Tartarus: isn't the problem we have more members than the
normal charter allows right now?
(1:26:39 PM) Tartarus: and we have (or had) a schedule for each of us
standing for election
(1:26:51 PM) Tartarus: But the problem is that once that happens, unless
someone looses, we'll have too many folks
(1:27:04 PM) Tartarus: And either need to change the official charter, or
have someone volunteer not to be elected
(1:27:14 PM) RP__: Well, eventually we'll be left with no seat for someone
(1:27:35 PM) Tartarus: Right, which is why we're seeing if someone wants to
step down, yes?
(1:27:51 PM) RP__: Its not up to us
(1:27:58 PM) RP__: There will be 5 elections. What I'm saying is that I'll
volunteer my seat as the first one to be elected
(1:28:17 PM) RP__: The board will call for candidates, I will stand, I don't
know who else will and we see who gets elected
(1:28:19 PM) Jefro: that is different indeed from volunteering to stand down
:)
(1:28:44 PM) Tartarus: Well, I'm confused now
(1:28:51 PM) Tartarus: Since that wasn't the last plan
(1:28:57 PM) khem: We were going alphabetically
(1:29:02 PM) Tartarus: Or are we putting all seats up at once?
(1:29:03 PM) RP__: People didn't seem happy with the last plan
(1:29:19 PM) ***koen has no problems with RPs plan
(1:29:57 PM) RP__: There will be 5 elections, one at a time, spread over a
period of time
(1:30:01 PM) khem: so how  does it go now ? every seat gets elected one by
one ?
(1:30:07 PM) khem: ok
(1:30:09 PM) Tartarus: So, i think I get it
(1:30:11 PM) RP__: For each one there will be a call for candidates
(1:30:16 PM) Jefro: so.. electing seats rather than individuals
(1:30:17 PM) Tartarus: It sounds to me like a wording change over the last
plan
(1:30:22 PM) khem: ok
(1:30:34 PM) Tartarus: So, whichever
(1:31:01 PM) RP__: There are 5 seats and for each of which there is an
election
(1:31:34 PM) RP__: Separate call for candidates and then people vote
(1:31:46 PM) khem: ok sounds a good plan
(1:32:08 PM) Jefro: RP__ who gets to organize and manage the vote?  is that
the board's responsibility?
(1:32:15 PM) RP__: Jefro: yes
(1:32:28 PM) RP__: Jefro: this is all documented procedure for the e.V.
(1:32:34 PM) Jefro: got it
(1:33:32 PM) RP__: So we wait for the board, we as a TSC just need to work
out how six become five
(1:34:05 PM) RP__: After one of the elections some who has given up their
seat will not be re-elected
(1:34:27 PM) RP__: Everyone happy?
(1:34:50 PM) ***RP__ takes that as a yes
(1:34:56 PM) RP__: 05) status updates
(1:35:16 PM) RP__: oe-core seems to be gaining momentum and certainly has
some healthy patch turnover
(1:35:21 PM) koen: I will manage the betting pool when the usual suspect
gets confused about voting again
(1:35:36 PM) RP__: yes there have been odd issues but I think we're dealing
with them ok
(1:35:42 PM) RP__: Does anyone have any comments on oe-core?
(1:35:47 PM) Tartarus: Yeah, I do
(1:36:00 PM) Tartarus: Do the autobuilders folks use currently have
no-distro configs in them?
(1:36:11 PM) Tartarus: I know we have poky, and I'm almost sure we have
angstrom and probably shr
(1:36:14 PM) RP__: Tartarus: Not the yocto ones
(1:36:32 PM) RP__: Tartarus: We're basically waiting on hardware atm
(1:36:37 PM) Tartarus: Would that be something we can put on the yocto ones?
 Or does OE need to come up with the HW for that?
(1:37:00 PM) Tartarus: RP__: can we at least add a single config to what's
going on now in the yocto one?
(1:37:07 PM) RP__: Tartarus: We have plans in place to be able to take extra
stuff but its six weeks off at least
(1:37:33 PM) RP__: Tartarus: I can put in the request but I know I'll get
screamed at
(1:37:53 PM) RP__: Tartarus: let me see what I can do
(1:37:53 PM) Tartarus: RP__: I think we really must have it, since that's
the default oe-core setting
(1:37:56 PM) Tartarus: thanks
(1:38:23 PM) koen: tom k mentioned he wanted to to a pure oe-core
autobuilder
(1:38:24 PM) RP__: Tartarus: keep in mind that we did slim the poky shim
layer down to the bare minimal
(1:38:28 PM) koen: but he needs hw for that as well
(1:38:39 PM) RP__: Yes, I think Tom will ultimately do this
(1:38:42 PM) Tartarus: RP__: yes, but still, since oe-core is supposed to
work on its own
(1:38:48 PM) RP__: but he's waiting for the same source of hardware as Yocto
(1:38:52 PM) Tartarus: We really really should have at least one autobuilder
confirming that's not dying
(1:38:54 PM) Jefro: RP__ not quite
(1:38:56 PM) RP__: Tartarus: I know it is
(1:39:13 PM) RP__: Jefro: In what way is this different?
(1:39:17 PM) Jefro: OE hardware is being donated by LF, who is waiting for
the donator to get back. there is progress in this way.
(1:39:26 PM) Jefro: Yocto's hardware is coming from a different source.
(1:39:46 PM) khem: RP__: I still think we need to work out a way so there is
no need for gcc 4.6 in meta-oe
(1:39:49 PM) RP__: Jefro: Lets talk offline about that
(1:39:53 PM) Jefro: RP__ yup
(1:39:55 PM) RP__: Jefro: You have partial info
(1:40:42 PM) RP__: khem: What is the current problem there?
(1:41:05 PM) RP__: khem: Is it just the linaro patches?
(1:41:11 PM) khem: RP__: yes
(1:41:26 PM) khem: RP__: I was think if we could just bbappend them
(1:41:43 PM) koen: khem: what I did for 4.5 was to only have the .bbs
(1:41:45 PM) RP__: khem: That would work too
(1:41:48 PM) koen: khem: the logic is in the .incs
(1:41:56 PM) khem: yeah
(1:42:13 PM) RP__: Lets take that to the mailing list
(1:42:23 PM) RP__: Anything else on oe-core?
(1:42:42 PM) khem: release
(1:43:10 PM) khem: I think we need some sort of release plan for oe-core
(1:43:45 PM) RP__: My current thinking is to time something with yocto's
1.1?
(1:44:04 PM) Jefro: I remembered there being a plan to release on .03 and
.09
(1:44:14 PM) khem: I think half yearly release would be optimum
(1:44:23 PM) RP__: coming up to that point yocto will want to stabilise so
that would benefit the oe-core release too
(1:44:35 PM) koen: I talked with Martin and my impression is that the
oe-core + meta-oe combo lacks too much to be usefull as a release
(1:45:03 PM) khem: koen: lacks ? in what sense
(1:45:05 PM) RP__: koen: what does it lack?
(1:45:21 PM) koen: martin can't build his usual images with it
(1:45:29 PM) koen: and I can't build my usual angstrom images with it
(1:45:50 PM) RP__: wouldn't some of the layers release at the same time?
(1:46:00 PM) khem: koen: so thats something we can roll into a release plan
 may be for oe
(1:46:02 PM) RP__: or release a version at some point which would work with
the releases oe-core?
(1:46:27 PM) koen: RP__: that's my point, an oe-core only release would not
buy "us" much
(1:46:39 PM) RP__: koen: you miss my point
(1:46:51 PM) khem: koen: so you mean it should be distro releases ?
(1:47:17 PM) RP__: koen: ideally it would be good if angstrom could release
at some point based on the oe-core release for the oe-core layer
(1:47:27 PM) khem: I still think folks can pick up  a oe-core release and
build their software around it
(1:47:54 PM) koen: RP__: I don't have enough working to call something a
release with a straight face
(1:48:02 PM) koen: RP__: and I think neither does martin
(1:48:03 PM) RP__: koen: not yet
(1:48:13 PM) khem: with git submodules its easy since it locks the
submodules by commit ids
(1:48:17 PM) RP__: koen: you don't think you'll be there in 3 months?
(1:48:58 PM) koen: RP__: realistically, no
(1:49:12 PM) RP__: koen: which areas are the concerns in?
(1:49:19 PM) ***RP__ is worried by this
(1:49:31 PM) khem: I think we need more recipes into meta-oe
(1:49:32 PM) koen: the big one in terms of recipes is a complete gnome 2.32
stack
(1:49:54 PM) koen: the big one in terms of base system is work out why
things like console setup are screwed
(1:49:55 PM) RP__: ok, so its the meta-oe issue, not something about oe-core
itself
(1:50:11 PM) khem: I think oe-core plays into it as well
(1:50:17 PM) RP__: It would be good to have a working list of things with
oe-core that are problems
(1:50:17 PM) khem: indirectly
(1:50:23 PM) RP__: those I can try and help with directly
(1:50:37 PM) RP__: meta-oe does need community help and may take a little
longer
(1:50:57 PM) khem: a release would bring over some devs
(1:51:28 PM) RP__: I think oe-core needs to release. Whether meta-oe does or
not at the 09 point I don't know
(1:51:30 PM) koen: RP__: I'm not against an oe-core release, but by the
looks of it only oe-core would release
(1:51:41 PM) RP__: koen: we have to start somewhere
(1:52:25 PM) khem: may be initially only yocto will be based of release and
slowly other distros will fall in as we go
(1:52:57 PM) khem: angstrom clearly has wide coverage and lot of different
images to consider
(1:52:57 PM) koen: RP__: that's very true, but we have to be carefull in the
messaging
(1:53:18 PM) RP__: koen: no argument from me
(1:53:59 PM) khem: we can discuss it more next week
(1:54:14 PM) koen: btw, 15 more members for the e.V.
(1:54:35 PM) Jefro: koen is there a link?
(1:54:41 PM) khem: good
(1:54:51 PM) RP__: ok, we have 5 mins left
(1:55:16 PM) RP__: I think if anyone has status updates on contrib
guidelines, bsp guidelines metadata layer splitting
(1:55:17 PM) khem: siteinfo in oe-core needs some makeover from oe.dev
(1:55:18 PM) RP__: raise them now
(1:55:21 PM) koen: Jefro: mail is underway
(1:55:25 PM) RP__: remaining topic was infrastructure
(1:55:28 PM) Jefro: koen cool
(1:55:48 PM) RP__: I think Yocto setup an interest group for this
(1:55:51 PM) Jefro: infrastructure we kind of covered earlier.  Tom has
linked up with LF and things are progressing.
(1:55:51 PM) koen: RP__: I raised the layer splitting internally at TI,
people are going to try out the current angstrom setup and report back
(1:56:06 PM) RP__: Can the OE and Yocto groups work together or is there a
reason to keep them separate?
(1:56:09 PM) Jefro: Yocto has a Yocto Infrastructure SIG, which Tom can join
if he likes - maybe should
(1:56:17 PM) Jefro: I talk with him a few times a week
(1:56:55 PM) ***RP__ proposes Tom should join the Yocto group rather than
form a separate one
(1:57:09 PM) RP__: at least see if that can work
(1:57:25 PM) Jefro: I think the orgs can definitely help each other out
here. I'll take action item to talk with Tom.
(1:57:29 PM) RP__: koen: sounds good, I'd be interested to know how that
foes
(1:57:32 PM) RP__: er, goes
(1:57:46 PM) ***RP__ needs to put the light on as touch typing isn't working
well
(1:58:24 PM) RP__: Anything else anyone wants to talk about?>
(1:58:29 PM) khem: not me
(1:58:33 PM) Tartarus: not me
