Would it perhaps make sense to reply to the original author with an
email confirming that his patch is now in Patchwork? It should include a
link to the patch series, too.

This could have several advantages:
      * submitters not aware of Patchwork or whether their target
        currently uses it learn about it and then can follow the
        progress of their patch
      * everyone gets a confirmation that the submission made it through
        the various mail servers and Patchwork itself

It still relies on the original submitter to watch out for breakages in
the processes, but I guess that can't be avoided with an asynchronous,
mail-based process.
