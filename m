Yes, that's possible (like for squid, maybe qtbase as well).

The problem is that qemux86 and qemux86-64 run on one builder, qemuarm
on another. Each build takes around 25-26 hours (depending on kind of
changes which were introduced since last time, almost any oe-core
upgrade means build from scratch, if I update just pending patches in
meta-oe/master-next, then it's 2-5 hours).

And this report is generated based on the state of qemuarm build.

So quite often I start all 3 at the same time, then some interesting
changes came in later, so qemux86-64 build picks them and because I know
it will take quite long time I re-trigger the qemuarm build to finish in
parallel (so qemux86 usually ends being the "oldest"). But to provide at
least some feedback I don't re-trigger another qemux86 build, because
that would add another day till the report is complete.

No of course another round is already running, hopefully I'll ignore the
temptation to add more changes to it while it's running and do something
better with my life - more consitent report should be available
tomorrow.
