When you say "_internal_ kernel headers", I assume you mean kernel
headers which aren't intended for user space.  But because of the
"Attempt to use kernel headers from user space" warning (or rather the
motivations behind the warning), I don't want to/ I can't use the exact
same headers for building apps which need public kernel API as I do for
building modules which use internal kernel headers.
