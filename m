Thanks to all for your input. The conclusion of this thread is:

1. One size doesn't fit all.
2. Most of the people was fine with the image based update.
3. The recommended way to keep the configuration is to have a separated 
data partition.
4. The partition scheme would be:
     1. boot. This is the usual boot partition
     2. rootfs. Partition used for normal operation.
     3. maintenance. This partition will be used to update rootfs.
     4. data. This will hold the configuration files. Not modified by
     updates.
