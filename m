I have a fix already queued for this, but I'm currently out of the office ..
I swear, every time I go on vacation, someone brings this up.

I've been waiting for the smoke to clear on the 2.0 release before
posting it .. so please, just a bit more patience and I'll send out
that series.

It's not 5 seconds. It is much more on some machines and configurations.

The point is that not everyone who is building modules depends on
other modules and not everyone that is building against the kernel
may even want modules built.

The fix is to just re-copy the symbols after kernel modules are
built, and put the onus on the recipe writer to depend on the
right task/variant. By default, do_shared_workdir won't have that
dependency, but anyone with a recipe that does depend on other
module symbols will get that extra copy and dependency created.
